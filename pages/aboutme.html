      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        Born (1992) and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, I graduated at the
        beginning of 2017 in Electrical/Telecommunications Engineering at the
        Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo. During my bachelor’s
        studies, I had the privilege of participating in the
        <em>Science without Borders</em> exchange program of the Federal
        Government. Therefore, for a year, I’ve lived abroad &mdash; more
        specifically, in Brussels, Belgium &mdash; studying engineering and, in
        parallel, improving my French and my abilities in
        <a href="https://fanaro.com.br/category/go-baduk-weiqi/"
          >Go (Baduk or Weiqi)</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>In 2017</strong>, after 5 years of love for the board game of Go
        &mdash; an Asian strategy game, analogous to chess both in prestige and
        complexity &mdash;, I had the opportunity of
        <a href="../articles/on_korea/on_korea.html"
          >living for a semester in South Korea</a
        >
        to improve my skills and, also, study topics related to the game, a very
        enriching experience through which I’ve come to know more about the
        surprisingly different ways of Asian thinking and behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>In 2018</strong>, after a semester of full-time studies for jobs
        in the government, especially for the Federal Police,
        <a href="../articles/reenter_engineering/reenter_engineering.html"
          >my interest in engineering was unexpectedly rekindled</a
        >, more specifically in the Machine Learning field, a component of the
        greater area of Data Science. I spent the rest of that year
        rehabilitating myself as a software developer, studying statistics,
        practicing my newly (re)developed Data Science skills and looking for a
        job in this new field.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>In 2019</strong>, in February, I managed to get an opportunity
        at well established retail software company in Brazil:
        <a href="http://www.zanthus.com.br/">Zanthus</a>. I and another
        colleague were supposed to create the new Data Science department and,
        hopefully, instill cultural changes in the corporation also. The
        available data wasn’t very clean or organized &mdash; besides the
        natural lack of a data-driven structure, since they couldn’t expect it
        to be a need years ago &mdash; and, therefore, it was very difficult to
        make anything work at the beginning. After around 3-4 months of
        exploration, some successful algorithms were developed<foot-note
          text='See the &lt;a href="https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes"&gt;Lifetimes library&lt;/a&gt;, 
          to which I used to be a contributor.'
        ></foot-note>
        and I was then charged with the development of the future data API that
        would take care of the back end of the future data-related products.
        After 4 more months of development, at the beginning of October, now
        with a functional &mdash; only for internal tests &mdash; minimal API
        (using the
        <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/"
          >Django REST Framework</a
        >
        and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>), I realized I had
        experienced a typical case of burnout, while disagreements with managers
        were stressing me even further. It was then that I decided to quit, and
        expand my programming abilities to other areas that could enhance my
        efficacy of delivering a product to another level entirely. Since this
        decision, I’ve been working as a freelance app developer with
        <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>, while
        <a
          href="../articles/universal_principles_design/universal_principles_design.html"
          >learning Design</a
        >, <a href="../articles/scrum_1/scrum_1.html">studying Scrum</a>, and
        much more.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>In 2020</strong>, I invested heavily in myself. What began as me
        trying to release an app into the wild ended up being a whole year of
        reinventing myself. It all started when
        <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg">Marcelo Glasberg</a>
        recommended me some books to aid my software engineering career.
        Realizing the gargantuan gap between me and the top professionals, I read
        20+ technical books throughout the year while creating 2 browser
        extensions &mdash;
        <a href="../articles/youtube_kbd_nav/youtube_kbd_nav.html"
          >YouTube Kbd Nav</a
        >
        and
        <a href="../articles/ogs_kbd_nav/ogs_kbd_nav.html">OGS Kbd Nav</a>
        &mdash;, working with Marcelo himself in a Dart collections package (<a
          href="../articles/fic/fic.html"
          >FIC</a
        >), rebuilding my website, and a whole lot more.
