        <p>
          I've been working with VS Code for more than 6 months now and I've
          tuned it to look quite attractive and practical. I would like for
          others to feel the same way about their VS Code versions, and that's
          why I'm sharing my settings here. If you see something that can be
          improved, please do let me know, try using the
          <code>Github Issues</code> feature &mdash; let's get this editor to
          utter perfection. Otherwise, enjoy :).

        <custom-h2 text="Why VS Code"></custom-h2>
        <p>
          VS Code has taken the programming world by storm. Corey Schafer, a
          much more experienced programmer than I mentions in
          <a href="https://youtu.be/-nh9rCzPJ20">one of his videos</a> that, in
          a coding event he goes to regularly, where he used to see a myriad of
          editors, VS Code is now almost unanimous.
        </p>
        <p>I believe there are 2 major factors for its success:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Lightweight</strong>: whereas previous good editors would
            take a lot processing and RAM, which would make some people even
            stick to very old school or bare bones editors like Emacs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Beautiful and with no clutter</strong>: its minimalist
            design focuses on having no needless features and the overall design
            feels sharp and modern.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>OS Independent</strong
            ><foot-note text="Almost."></foot-note>: VS Code was programmed
            using <a href="https://electronjs.org/">ElectronJS</a>, a JavaScript
            layer on top of the programming languages used for developing
            software for different operating systems. This allows for
            almost<foot-note text="Still a lot of work actually."></foot-note>
            no OS incompatibility and grants the software a cleaner look.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>More importantly: it's open source</strong> (you can simply
            go to
            <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode"
              >its Github repository</a
            >
            and see how they coded it). Open Source code makes the code
            available for users to customize<foot-note
              text="It isn't free. You can look at the code,
          but not use it commercially or indiscriminately."
            ></foot-note>
            and point out bugs. In practice, in general, software companies have
            experienced great boosts in development and user satisfaction by
            open sourcing their codes. This is a lesson taken from the previous
            and fairly recent editor that planted the seeds for VS Code:
            <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a
            ><foot-note
              text="Atom was created by Github,
          which was in turn created by Linus Torvalds, the Linux creator and a
          big advocate of Open Source code."
            ></foot-note
            >.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          VS Code adopts JSON for its settings, something seen nowadays as a
          best practice, as it is very simple, lightweight and, more
          importantly, conventional &mdash; which makes people's management much
          easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the standard configuration is to open an UI to deal with
          configuration. This can thankfully be changed by placing
          <code>"workbench.settings.editor" : "json"</code>
          in the user's configuration, which you can access by typing
          <code>Ctrl + Shift + P</code>, looking for <em>settings</em> and then
          choosing <code>Open User Settings (JSON)</code>. The
          <em>default settings</em> are only so you can take a look at what's
          available; if you see something you want to change, override it when
          placing it in the <em>user settings</em>. For example, you can use my
          configurations by simply copying my
          <code>settings.json</code>
          file content into <em>your</em> user's configuration. If this looks
          all too complicated, there are several tutorials on Youtube (including
          <a href="https://youtu.be/-nh9rCzPJ20">one from Corey Schafer</a>
          that's very nice) and there's also the
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings"
            >official documentation</a
          >, which is <em>not</em> as unfriendly as your regular software docs.
        </p>
        I've added comments to all of my customization, but the ones I feel
        aggregate the most value are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter</code>: by setting this to
            <code>"off"</code>, you avoid pressing enter and accidentally
            inserting one of the suggestions. Now suggestions will only happen
            when pressing <code>Tab</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>window.titleBarStyle</code>: this ditches your OS title bar
            when set to <code>"custom"</code>; overall a cleaner visual.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>workbench.editor.enablePreview</code> : by default, VS Code
            opens <em>previews</em> of the files; only when you edit them do
            they become actual <em>editor windows</em>. If you wish to open
            multiple files then, VS Code will keep overriding the same tab,
            which is not typically what you want.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>editor.minimap.renderCharacters</code> : the characters in the
            <em>Mini Map</em> are... mini. So what's the point in rendering
            them? You just want an outline, the sky's view, and not rendering
            the characters does exactly that.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>editor.fontLigature</code>
            : only some fonts enable this feature, and one of them is the
            <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a> font.
            <em>Font Ligatures</em> create more visually pleasing and concise
            symbols for coding syntax &mdash; for example, the usual
            <code>!=</code> different symbol becomes the actual mathematical
            different symbol: <code>â‰ </code>. Under the hood, these symbols stay
            the same, it's just a visual feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>explorer.autoReveal</code>
            : VS Code autofocuses the file explorer to the current file you're
            editing. This can be very annoying at (most) times, so you can
            disable it with this configuration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>workbench.settings.editor</code>
            : by choosing
            <code>"json"</code>
            here, you force VS Code to open the JSON version of the
            configurations whenever you press
            <code>Ctrl + ,</code>
            or open the settings through the command palette.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>explorer.confirmDragAndDrop</code>
            : you don't have to confirm every file manipulation you make in the
            file explorer tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>extensions.ignoreRecommendations</code> : ignore all of the
            software recommendations VS Code gives you. They can be useful at
            times, but they are annoying more often than not.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>editor.multiCursorModifier</code>
            : this cool little feature lets you
            <code>Ctrl + Click</code>
            on multiple lines and then make changes to them at the same time.
            Very practical sometimes, and, more importantly, awesome.

                In my humble opinion, the best theme ever for coding. It's dark,
                and doesn't have that big a contrast, which makes it easy on the
                eyes.
              </li>
              <li>
                It became incredibly popular with the rise of the

              </li>
              <li>
                This amazing extension lets you concatenate shortcut commands, a
                desperately needed feature to the
                <code>keybindings.json</code>
                file.
              </li>
              <li>
                I have one example on my settings that uses
                <code>alt+t</code>
                to copy-paste code and execute it on the Integrated Terminal,
                while also focusing on it.

                For those of you who need to create virtual environments and
                packages that work independently of the user's configurations,
                Docker is a must. And this extension offers much more than
                simply a linter, while also being maintained by Microsoft
                itself.

                <code>reStructuredText</code>
                is similar to
                <code>Markdown</code>. But it's very common in Python
                documentation extensions, such as Sphinx. So it's very useful to
                have syntax and linting support for it &mdash; though,
                admittedly, this extension could be better.

        <p>
          Customizing shortcuts is something I haven't put that much effort in.
          Besides the fact that VS Code has already many useful ones, it's very
          difficult to come up with a good key combination without overriding an
          existing (and probably useful) one. Nonetheless, I have been able to
          add 2 that are very useful &mdash; I really don't understand why they
          don't come out of the box &mdash;:
          <em>switching through terminals</em> (there is already one for
          focusing on the terminal tab itself though: <code>Ctrl + `</code
          ><foot-note
            text="Note that you can also switch editor groups
        with &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + &lt;group_number&gt;&lt;/code&gt;; and tabs inside the
        editor group with &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Tab&lt;/code&gt;"
          ></foot-note
          >).
        </p>
        And I've also managed to add shortcuts for:
        <em>copy-pasting code to the integrated terminal and executing it</em>;
        <em
          >copy-pasting code to the terminal and executing it while also
          focusing on the integrated terminal</em
        >. For the last one, it was necessary to use a
        <em>macros</em> extension, since there was a need for the concatenation
        of shortcuts. In order to create it: add this to your
        <code>settings.json</code> file:
        <pre>
        <code class="json">multiCommand.commands: [
    {
        "command" : "multiCommand.copyPasteTerminalAndFocus",
        "sequence": [
            {
                "command" : "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence"
                "args" : {"text" : "${selectedText}\u000D"} 
                // `\u000D` is a `Return`
            },
            "workbench.action.terminal.focus"
        ]
    }
]</code>
      </pre>

        <p>
          And then create the shortcut in the <code>keybindings.json</code> file
          by adding:
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code class="json">{   // Copy Paste to the Integrated Terminal and Focus on it 
    "key" : "alt+t",
    "command" : "multiCommand.copyPasteTerminalAndFocus"
}</code>
      </pre>
