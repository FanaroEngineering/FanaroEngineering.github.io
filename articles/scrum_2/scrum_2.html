      <h1>Scrum, by Jeff Sutherland, Part 2 : The Most Useful Lessons</h1>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        This is what I really wanted to post about when I first created this
        series, however, coming out bluntly with this content, without context,
        seemed strange, so that's why I created
        <a
          href="http://fanaro.com.br/scrum-by-jeff-sutherland-the-book-everyone-should-read-part-1/"
          >the first (really long) post</a
        >
        of this series, in order to introduce the topic more gently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I will be writing about some of the most pragmatic topics of the
        management discussion in the
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=scrum+sutherland&amp;qid=1567260782&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1"
          >book</a
        >. The 6 most important and impactful ones are, in my opinion &mdash;
        their brief titles will hopefully be more clear later on &mdash;:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Teams Outpacing the (huge) Disparity between Individuals (p. 41)
        </li>
        <li>Communication Channels inside Teams (p. 59)</li>
        <li>The Multitasking Loss Table (p. 90)</li>
        <li>Fixing Mistakes Now vs Fixing Mistakes Later (p. 98)</li>
        <li>The Productivity/Burnout Graph (p. 102)</li>
        <li>How We (should) Will All Work One Day (p. 222)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Before you start, I would like to add that \( Production = Productivity
        \times Hours \ of \ Work \). Most people will force themselves and their
        colleagues to increase the last term, but only to later find out that
        productivity dropped due to burnout; and that the production output is
        either less or equal to before. What we should actually focus on is
        productivity, efficiency. It will grant us a more enjoyable experience,
        more time and, as research shows repeatedly,
        <em>more production</em>.

          41") where you will find the respective discussion inside the book.
          I've read it in the Kindle version, but the pages there are indexed in
          the same order as they appear in the physical version.</em

      <h1>
        1. Teams Outpacing the (huge) Disparity between Individuals (p. 41)
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is something closely related to my experience as a team athlete
        more than 10 years ago. People who have never had experience with teams,
        where the goal necessarily demands that everyone help each other, tend
        to display very selfish behavior; and I've seen some report that they
        would rather do the work by themselves because their colleagues are not
        as good or present a waste of time for them. This is not only selfish
        but irrational and wrong, because the point is to compete
        <em>against other teams, not against your own</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this light, it was then appalling to me when I saw Go players having
        poor reactions while playing in pairs: they had developed such an
        individualistic point of view of the game that they couldn't positively
        interact with someone who wasn't at the level of their standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Needless to say that working in teams is basically mandatory in the real
        world. Individually, it would take us forever to complete the same
        projects teams can tackle. And yet, we tend to not teach people how to
        properly play on teams, we tend to put an erroneously enormous value on
        individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        When hiring, we would like to simplify our choices by simply looking for
        <em>the</em> best professionals, the best individuals. However, some
        studies indicate that prioritizing individuals might be a crucial
        mistake,
        <strong
          >we should actually put more importance on how the individual can work
          with the team.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In a Yale study trying to figure out what separated top from normal
        (computer science) students, it was found that
        <strong
          >the fastest students outpaced their slow counterparts by a ratio of
          10:1</strong
        >. Impressive, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
        In another study that looked at some 3,800 different projects, ranging
        from work done at accounting firms to software development for
        battleships to tech projects at IBM, the researchers discovered that
        <strong
          >the fastest teams outpaced the slowest by a whopping 1000:1
          ratio</strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The borderline here is: who cares about 10:1 ratios when you can gain
        1000:1 if you invest elsewhere?
      </p>
      <p>
        What, then, separates a mediocre from a lightning fast team? The biggest
        challenge to getting into the 1000:1 select club is actually the
        mindset. It takes convincing, it takes a lot of arguments, it takes
        talking to people and being (wrongfully) rejected multiple times. But,
        once the change is made, the span of improvement is jaw-dropping high.
        As Sutherland puts it later in the book:
      </p>
      <p>
        I can double a team’s productivity in a month, but an individual? That
        could take a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, what usually seems as an overinvestment on teams is probably
        not the case, because the rewards are actually astronomical. Committing
        yourself to improving teamwork is probably more valuable to everyone
        than improving yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scrum has this team focus implicit in its foundations. For example,
        <em>Daily Stand-Ups </em>were created as a way to share information and
        enhance team synergy. In a study that tried to find out how people can
        code faster, one of the subjects was the legendary team at Borland, in
        which each coder was writing a 1,000 lines each week. Their key to this
        was that their communication saturation had the highest rating ever: 90%
        (most companies hover around 20%). What was the source of this very
        impressive rating? One hour Daily Meetings &mdash; Sutherland mentions
        that he thinks that's a bit too long; that's why Scrum's Daily Stand-Ups
        last 15 minutes at most.
      </p>

      <h1>2. Communication Channels inside Teams (p. 59)</h1>
      <p>
        It's a common saying, at least in software development, that large teams
        only make projects take longer. That mostly comes from experience, but
        it also has a scientific background.
      </p>
      <p>
        In teams, people have to communicate to each other. Information has to
        flow, to be shared. In this way, the group will develop
        <em>communication channels</em> between every couple of individuals. By
        connecting everyone, the total amount of communication channels in the
        team grows very fast. If you wish to prove it to yourself, draw polygons
        of increasing number of sides and connect all of the vertices to each
        other. In the end, you might realize that the number of
        <strong
          >Communication Channels (CC) follows the following quadratic
          formula:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>\[ CC = \frac{n^2}{2} - \frac{n}{2} = \frac{n (n - 1)} {2} \]</p>
      [caption id="attachment_1420" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<img
        class="wp-image-1420 size-full"
        src="http://fanaro.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/communication_channels.jpg"

        height="300"
      />
      Example of drawing <em>Communication Channels</em> in a group or
      team.[/caption]
      <p>
        <strong
          >Research has shown that we can only keep 4 (sometimes up to 7 at
          best) pieces of information at the same time, in our
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory"
            ><em>working memory</em></a
          ></strong
        >. A more or less classic team formulation is of 7 +- 2 people, because
        the number of communication channels can range from CC(5) = 10 to CC(9)
        = 36, which we can kind of manage optimally, but is already frightening
        in comparison to what our working memory can handle. Now, imagine when
        you put a seemingly not that many 12 people on the same team. While we
        would have 15 communication channels in a team of 6 people, this number
        grows to 66 for 12 people, basically 4x<foot-note
          text="This comes from the quadratic formula... 2^2 = 4."
        ></foot-note>
        what is considered manageable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having too many people on the same team will not only be a catastrophe
        because it will be difficult to achieve good communication, but because
        <strong>information will spread very slowly</strong> and, since there
        will also be more steps (people) before it stabilizes,
        <strong>it will more easily become corrupted</strong>, leading to a
        scenario where misinformation happens more frequently, causing people to
        invest a lot of time into fixing what they do because it was probably
        wrongly specified. So, what managers should do is to actually keep their
        teams small. If you have a department &mdash; please, try to eliminate
        departments...<foot-note
          text="For more info, read the last section of this article."
        ></foot-note>
        &mdash; with more than 9 people, it's better to break it into smaller
        teams.
      </p>

      <h1>3. The Multitasking Table (p. 90)</h1>
      <p>
        It is common to witness "highly productive" executives bragging about
        how they can multitask and juggle multiple projects at the same time.
        But that actually should <em>not </em>be a source of pride. Research has
        shown time and again that multitasking is a highly inefficient way of
        spending one's time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Every time you switch from a context to another, your brain takes
          time to readjust itself and, more often than not, you will also have
          to recreate a specific hardware or software setup in order to properly
          manage the task, which adds to the inefficiency.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In one of the classic works on how to develop computer software,
        <em>Quality Software Management</em>, by Gerald Weinberg, the
        <strong>Context Switching Table</strong> is presented &mdash; which was
        mostly built from experience with a reasonably large amount of projects
        &mdash;:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Number of Simultaneous Projects</th>
            <th>Time Available per Project (%)</th>
            <th>Loss to Context Switching (%)</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>100</td>
            <td>0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>40</td>
            <td>20</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>20</td>
            <td>40</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>60</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>75</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        For example, if you have <em>only </em>2 projects to be managed, already
        your inherent loss to context switching goes to 20%, which is
        unexpectedly high. But, if you go to the extremes of where most
        executives live (5+), you will find that each project will have
        effectively only at best 5% of the available time.
      </p>
      Besides the loss to context switching and the intuitive fact that juggling
      tasks is very exhausting, there's also the fact that
      <strong
        >keeping more than one project in your brain makes you
        <em>think</em> slower:</strong
      >
      <p>
        A scientist named Harold Pashler demonstrated this in the early 1990s.
        He called it “Dual Task Interference.” He conducted a few simple
        experiments. He would have one group do one really simple thing, say
        press a button if a light went on. And then he’d give another group that
        task plus another simple one, like pressing a different button depending
        on the color of the flashing light.
        <strong
          >As soon as another task was added, no matter how simple, the time
          involved doubled</strong
        >. Pashler theorized that there was some sort of processing bottleneck —
        that people can really only think about one thing at a time. He reckoned
        that a certain amount of effort is involved in “packing up” one process,
        reaching into your memory and pulling out another, and then running that
        job. And each time you switch tasks, that process takes time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is true that sometimes it is inevitable to multitask, but that should
        be avoided and the exception, and definitely not in the bragging
        standards.
      </p>

      <h1>4. Fixing Mistakes Now vs</h1>
      <h1>Fixing Mistakes Later (p. 98)</h1>
      <p>
        Regarding production efficiency, it seems logical to think that it would
        be much easier to systematically take notes of what is not correct
        across the production line and then, at the end, have a team fix all the
        issues all at once. But things are not that simple...
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do it that way, there will most likely be an informational loss
        between the person diagnosing the error at first glance and what the
        fixer will see. Not only is it an interpretational problem, but there is
        also the fact that other components will be built on top of the mistake,
        which might change the behavior the fixer later sees, possibly leading
        to a <em>very</em> different diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building on top of mistakes seems to be argument enough for people to
        discard fixing issues at the end of the production line. But,
        unexpectedly, it is in use in many companies, including some that pride
        themselves in their service or product quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW are some of the examples — at least at the
        time of the writing of the book. For BMW, it would take 57 hours to make
        a car, and they would have 78.7 defects for every 100 vehicles. Of the
        57 hours, 15 to 20 would be spent trying to fix all of the issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, Toyota, Honda and Nissan would take 16.8 hours to
        manufacture their high-end cars,
        <em>with only 34 defects per 100 vehicles.</em>
        <strong
          >The German manufacturers were taking more time to fix their cars than
          the Japanese were taking to manufacture a totally new one from zero to
          finish.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The mistake here is assuming that fixing mistakes should be in the same
        category of any other production task. But it absolutely is not.<strong>
          It is much easier and quicker to fix mistakes right away</strong
        >
        rather than later because, as previously mentioned,
        <strong>nothing will have corrupted the source of the problem</strong>,
        it will be easier to find the root cause and you won't have to undo
        anything. For these reasons, the Japanese manufacturers will have all of
        their line workers capable of fixing a problem and, in order to not have
        the production line stop, whenever an issue arises, all of the nearby
        workers swarm it and fix it as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to computer software, the problem is similar, but maybe
        even more drastic. A company called Palm, which developed some of the
        very first PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), managed to track
        automatically everything they were coding, including bugs and testing.
        Later, in an internal study, they analyzed how much time it took to fix
        a bug — i.e., how much time it took a software developer to fix a
        problem he'd introduced into the system. More specifically,
        <strong
          >they analyzed the difference between <em>fixing the bug now</em> and
          <em>fixing the bug later </em>(3 weeks) — much like Toyota's and BMW's
          productions lines —, with data coming from hundreds of
          developers.</strong
        >
        What do you think was the difference?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>It took 24x longer to do it later</strong> — if you had not
        given the proper value to <em>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</em> yet,
        now is your chance. Procrastinate and a 1-hour bug will turn into a
        whole 24-hour ordeal. In short, <em>do things right the first time</em>.
      </p>

      <h1>5. The Productivity/Burnout Graph (p. 102)</h1>
      <p>
        In the book, Sutherland mentions the story of Scott Maxwell. Scott
        worked at McKinsey &amp; Company in the early 1990s and had to endure
        the firm's culture of inhuman overworking. The bare minimum was to
        basically work 7 days a week. For religious reasons, Maxwell was
        <em>only</em> able to work 6 times a week. However he soon realized
        that, somehow, he was able to deliver <em>more</em> than his more
        hard-working colleagues that came in all day everyday. How?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >When working too many hours, we inevitably get tired, and, therefore,
          it becomes very easy to involuntarily and unconsciously make
          mistakes</strong
        >. In the end, very often, his colleagues would be using their working
        hours to create and fix their own mistakes without even noticing the
        pattern. Slowly, he managed retract into <em>only</em> working 5 days a
        week, later finding out that he was still delivering more than his
        colleagues. He thought about trying to work for only 4 days a week, but
        was afraid of the repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, when Maxwell got his own venture capital firm, he crossed paths
        with Jeff Sutherland, who inspired him into studying and investing on
        the topic again. This time, after collecting some data, he came up with
        his <em>Maxwell Curve</em>, i.e.,
        <em>Amount of Work Produced vs Hours of Work per Week</em
        ><foot-note
          text="For those who haven't been following the series, Scrum and Waterfall are

        ></foot-note
        >. The results are shocking to some workaholics. And should be a very
        big lesson to executives who love to micromanage their subordinates and
        force them to go beyond the usual 40h/week journey.

        With the results given by Scrum and other new methods of management, it
        is clear that it is time to break away from the traditional, old
        methods. But how?

      The answer might be to, counter-intuitively, literally free the company.
      Enter <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/">Valve</a> — the
      legendary game developers —:
      <p>
        Formed in the 1990s as a videogame company making revolutionary hits
        such as Half-Life and Portal, Valve is completely self-funded and owns
        all its intellectual property. Almost all of its 300-plus employees are
        located in a single office tower in Bellevue, Washington. The company
        has over fifty million customers, and it makes hundreds of millions of
        dollars a year. <strong>And no one is really in charge.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        What do they mean by no one is completely in charge? Here is an excerpt
        of

        It’s our shorthand way of saying that we don’t have any management, and
        nobody “reports to” anybody else. We do have a founder/president, but
        even he isn’t your manager. This company is yours to steer — toward
        opportunities and away from risks. You have the power to green-light
        projects. You have the power to ship products.
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        A flat structure removes every <em>organizational barrier</em> between
        your work and the customer enjoying that work. Every company will tell
        you that “the customer is boss,” but here that statement has weight.
        There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what our
        customers want, and then giving it to them.
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        If you’re thinking to yourself, “Wow, that sounds like a lot of
        responsibility,” you’re right.

        Every Valve desk has wheels. Once people have agreed on a product or
        project, they move their tables to a more fitting area in order to
        better work together. It's a living organism!

        Micromanagement and infinite reports become common practice. While that
        is the only way of making <em>some </em>people work,
        <strong
          >many, if not most, actually <em>do</em> want to work and

          text="Don't penalize those who want to work because those that don't

        ></foot-note>
        and micromanaging them will cripple their abilities innovate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, Valve has to be very careful when hiring people, and, in
        their manual, they emphasize that
        <strong
          >hiring is the single most important task in the whole company</strong
        >. Without people with the correct mindset and capabilities, the whole
        environment might work against the company's values and objectives.

      <p>
        Continuing Valve's justified rant about
        <em>the typical organizational structure</em>:
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        Valve is not averse to all organizational structure — it crops up in
        many forms all the time, temporarily. But problems show up when
        hierarchy or codified divisions of labor either haven’t been created by
        the group’s members or when those structures persist for long periods of
        time.
        <strong
          >We believe those structures inevitably begin to serve their own needs
          rather than those of Valve’s customers. The hierarchy will begin to
          reinforce its own structure by hiring people who fit its shape, adding
          people to fill subordinate support roles.</strong
        >
        Its members are also incented to engage in rent-seeking behaviors that
        take advantage of the power structure rather than focusing on simply
        delivering value to customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evidently, unfortunately,
        <strong>not all departments can work like that.</strong> Support and IT
        departments, for example, even at Valve, still do have more or less
        traditional structures. Nevertheless, we shouldn't stick so fiercely to
        old models, to the comfortable <em>status quo</em> that has repeatedly
        been proven to instill bad habits, low quality of life and low
        productivity.

        a good fit — note that there is no assumption that you need to be a
        software company for these methods to work; in fact, many other
        companies already use them in other areas, such as building cars that
        get over a hundred miles per gallon (<a href="http://wikispeed.org/"
          >Team Wikispeed</a
        >) or being the global leader in tomato processing (Morning Star).
