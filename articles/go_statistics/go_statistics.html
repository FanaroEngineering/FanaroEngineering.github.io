      <h1>Some Interesting Go Statistics</h1>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Introduction"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          This is part of an experiment I’ve been wanting to do for quite some
          time, I’ve always wanted to know some Go statistics. Now that I have
          the massive
          <a href="https://gogodonline.co.uk/">GoGoD</a> database<foot-note
            text="The go4go database also seems to be quite adequate for this 
            sort of task."
          ></foot-note
          >, I can finally try it out. In this post I will focus on only a few
          questions though; nonetheless, I would love to hear if people have
          other creative ones that could be answered with the same data.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I did was to simply scan all of the games from the GoGoD database
          using Python and Regular Expressions (patterns in text) to extract the
          information from each SGF file. After going through all the pain of
          scraping the database, I found out that the database software it ships
          with allows for exporting all the data (except for the games
          themselves) through a CSV file. But when I tried that feature, it
          wasn’t working properly, the exporting process would always give me an
          error. Thus, I continued on with my code, it wasn’t a waste of time
          after all &mdash; I did learn many things about regular expressions
          anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the painstaking process of extracting the data, I finally
          managed to get everything into a Pandas DataFrame; it’s a bit tough on
          your computer since it has approximately 200 MB of data, but ok. If
          you get rid of the moves column, it goes down to only 13 MB. Anyway, I
          don’t want to make either of the tables freely available because it
          probably infringes a lot of the copyrights of the GoGoD database.
          Despite that, I can make my code available, as you can basically only
          try it if you have paid for the product, and you can find it in this
          <a href="https://github.com/psygo/GoGoD">Github Repo</a> &mdash; if
          you have the know-how, try checking and reproducing my results, it’s
          important to have results verified in science after all… Now let’s
          move on to some of the statistics.

        <p>
          This one is not so interesting since you can just manually scrape
          <a href="https://go4go.net/go/">go4go</a> and find out who the
          champions are. It’s no surprise to any veteran Go player that the
          winners of the ranking would be Cho Chikun 9p and Cho Hunhyeon 9p.
          Nonetheless, here are the top 10 as of the date I bought the database,
          about 3 months ago:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Cho Chikun (2142)</li>
          <li>Cho Hunhyeon (2023)</li>

          <li>Rin Kaiho (1705)</li>
          <li>Hashimoto Utaro (1552)</li>

        <custom-h2 text="Mean Length of a Go Game"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          I think it was in the Ogawa & Davies’s book about the yose (endgame)
          that I first read about this statistic, and it seems that they were
          pretty much on point, because in the book they estimated &mdash;
          probably from studies with pros &mdash; it as 220; and, from this
          database, it seems to be around 208<foot-note
            text="In my code, it will be 206.9, but my parser seems to be 
            missing one move for every Go file, so we should sum 1 point to the 
            mean. Anyway, it isn’t that much of a difference."
          ></foot-note
          >. If you move forward to recent times, the average seems to have only
          been going up: 198 for the first 20,000 games, and upwards to 215 in
          the last 5,000. This increase in the length of games is probably an
          effect of the highly competitive environment we have today.
        </p>

        <p>
          In their book about the endgame, that number was used to show that not
          only is Go a marathon, but about half of the game is spent in the
          yose, because the last part of the game usually ranges from 100-150
          moves. Henceforth, I hope you have no excuse for neglecting the
          endgame.
        </p>

        <p>
          This kind of statistic is also somewhat relevant for calculating the
          complexity of Go. One common estimate is to assume that, on average,
          Go has 5 candidate moves per turn<foot-note
            text="Don’t ask me the rationale behind that. It probably comes 
            from someone’s intuition."
          ></foot-note
          >, which yields \(5^{210} \approx 10^{146}\) plausible games. For
          chess, people often use \(3^{50} \approx 10^{24}\) for humans; and
          \(3^{80} \approx 10^{38}\) for machines.

        <p>
          What is the percentage of players for each rank<foot-note
            text="I’ve used only the final career rank of each player."
          ></foot-note
          >? That’s probably the most curious statistic of this post/exercise.
          Since our era is much different than the past or the overall Go
          history, I decided to plot 3 graphs, one for the last 20,000 games
          (out of 94,000), one for the 20,000 games before that, and one for all
          of the games. You can see the results below.

        </figure>

        <p>
          It seems that nowadays a quarter of the active players is composed by
          9 dan professionals, even though it’s the highest rank, which is
          understandable because the end of the ranking acts as a bottleneck. I
          would explain the higher numbers for the 1p-3p range as coming from
          the fact that the effort to get there is much smaller than getting to
          5p &mdash; there are some automatic promotions up to a certain rank
          &mdash; and beyond, or at least that’s how most Go associations seem
          to think it should be.
        </p>

        <p>
          As for the global results, I would say that today’s ranking system is
          harder?<foot-note
            text="It could also be that there are far more players turning pro 
            today than in the past. We would have to investigate more."
          ></foot-note>
          We have basically the same effect in less recent times (second graph),
          but the first bottleneck then was not at 1p-3p, it was around 5p, so I
          guess people are stagnating sooner nowadays. Is the root cause of all
          this too much competition? Too many pros having to quit to find other
          jobs? This would be a worthwhile comparison and study for the Asian Go
          Associations, since it would show with numbers what is going on with
          young professionals.

        <custom-h2 text="Winning Percentages for Black and White"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          Out of all the games we have (close to 94,000), Black seems to have a
          slight edge, at a 51.5% win rate. But, if you check the most recent
          games, say, the last 5,000, the trend flips, and now White has the
          approximate 51.5%.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main problem with komi or trying to correct the percentage to the
          perfect 50% is that, besides being inherently imbalanced, due to the
          unattainable 0.5 point, there might not be a perfect compensation,
          maybe the 19×19 board is imbalanced by definition. At any rate, this
          1.5% sliver is kind of minuscule and shouldn’t change anyone’s life
          &mdash; except for Ke Jie 9p’s… &mdash;, I mean at least until the
          droids become living beings.

          That’s it for me, I’m kind of out of ideas and wanting to enjoy my
          vacation. I hope this article will spark some new questions somewhere,
          just so we can explore them together.
