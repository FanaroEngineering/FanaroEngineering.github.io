      <h1>Scripted Classes vs Consulting or Private Lessons</h1>

      <p>
        It's 2021 and we are still stuck with the same educational system and
        logic from more than 200 years ago. Everyone complains, everyone
        criticizes it, and we still can't seem to move on.
      </p>

        Most teachers I asked about this topic actually agree with me, but what
        can they do, really? They are mostly cogs on the machine, and they all
        depend on the system for their livelihoods, so it's comprehensible when
        they don't do anything about it.

        But giving out the same lectures year after sets "understandable" as the
        ceiling for the situation of the educational system and teachers
        worldwide. That wouldn't be the case in the 1950s of course, however,
        ignoring the massive change which the ability of recording lectures has
        imparted seems beyond absurd and illogical to me.
