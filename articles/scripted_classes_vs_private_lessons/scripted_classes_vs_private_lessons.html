        <p>
          The numbering below does not reflect any hierarchy of values, it's
          just for reference purposes:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            The current situation of the educational system is
            <em>understandable</em> but not <em>acceptable</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every ounce of effort spent trying to change the current system from
            within might backfire into preserving it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ability to record lectures diminishes the need for this
            repetitive task, which frees up the teacher's time, leaving more
            time for private, targeted tutoring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Motivation has always been one of the major tasks of teaching.
            Mandatory lectures mask this, obfuscating the problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scripted or group lectures do not offer almost any value when it
            comes social interactions. Most social interactions derived from
            them happen afterwards, which could happen with recorded lectures
            anyway.
          </li>
          <li>
            No amount of lecturing will ever address all individual perspectives
            and perceptions of a subject.
          </li>
          <li>
            The current trend of teaching methodologies is just another for of
            lecturing, which offer considerable diminishing returns when
            compared to private lessons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Theory isn't enough, practice and constant feedback is what builds
            expertise.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Hasn't the pandemic proven that overemphasis on theory isn't
                enough to be able to solve a problem?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Scripted classes are time-wise practical for the teacher but
            time-wise impractical for the student.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scripted classes create bad habits: scripted answers.

            <ul>
              <li>
                And they might also be at the origin of the test epidemic in our
                educational systems.

        <custom-h2 text="The Current System"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          It's 2021 and we are still stuck with the same educational system and
          logic from more than about 200 years ago. Everyone complains, everyone
          criticizes it, and we still can't seem to move on.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most teachers I've asked about this topic actually agree with me, but
          what can they do, really? They are mostly cogs in the machine, and
          they all depend on this system for their livelihoods, so it's
          comprehensible when they can't or don't do anything about it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nonetheless, giving out the same lectures year after year sets
          "understandable" as the ceiling for the situation of the educational
          system and teachers worldwide. And that's a really low bar if you ask
          me.
        </p>

        <p>
          But maybe we are being too harsh, this problem really does seem very
          hard to solve after all, it really looks like the type of problem
          almost inherent to the fabric humanity. How else would we teach
          anything?
        </p>

        <p>
          Up to probably the 1950s, I would totally agree with the previous
          paragraphs. Giving out the same lessons year after year did indeed
          seem to be an immutable property of life. However, the ability to
          <em>record lectures</em> changes everything. By recording lessons, we
          can eliminate the repetitive and boilerplate work, and focus on each
          individual student's questions and difficulties, the teacher's time
          isn't dumped into this unnecessary task anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the major criticisms about leaning heavily on the recording
          lectures methodology is that the teacher now has to enforce students
          to watch the lectures, because, if they don't, then she will need to
          answer repetitive questions individually again and again. But allow me
          to reframe this objection: aren't students forced to watch lectures in
          the current system anyway? And isn't one of the most important aspects
          of teaching simply instilling motivation in students?
        </p>

        <p>
          Just like when discussing cryptocurrencies, every critique of this new
          approach seems to be, in reality, a critique of the current system.
          The lack of motivation in current students isn't inherent to students,
          it's just a problem the current system fails to address. More passive,
          scripted lectures, and more mandatory subjects won't make the
          situation any better; in fact, anyone with the slightest of experience
          in this system will agree it will likely only make it worse
          <foot-note
            text="This whole problem is one of the raison d'Ãªtre of systems like
          &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education'&gt;Montesori&lt;/a&gt;."

          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          And no, I'm not advocating for the total extinction of group
          lecturing, I'm just arguing that it should be a much rarer occurrence
          than it is now, its benefits are diminishing everyday, with new
          technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what about the social aspect of being part of lectures? Well,
          that's as much bad logic as going to the cinemas for dating: you're
          not having almost any social interaction when all parties are
          individually focused. Most of the social aspect people remember coming
          from lectures actually come from <em>after</em> them, and that same
          conversation or interaction could happen if you had seen the lecture
          in video form, asynchronously. I do agree, though, that the social
          bond of live lectures, even online, tends to be much stronger than
          other options, but I don't believe it justifies its existence as the
          default mode of learning, or outweighs the negatives.

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="My Suggestion"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          My suggestion is simple: lean more heavily on using technologies to
          help diminish the amount of repetitive teaching, while saving the
          teacher's time to use in private lessons and invididual consulting.
        </p>

        <p>
          To me, that's even a no-brainer when you analyze the best
          professionals in the market. Most of them have had great advisors or
          bosses in order to get to the top: master artisans don't learn
          everything from the ether. Even Mozart, likely the greatest musical
          genius, had the help of father, one of the greatest violinist of his
          time<foot-note
            text="Leopold Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's father, wrote violin
            instruction manuals which are used to this day."
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps the most important reason for imparting more importance on
          private lessons is that
          <em
            >no amount of lecturing will ever address all individual
            perspectives and perceptions of a subject</em
          >. Paraphrasing it, that means we cannot address all the possible
          interpretations students will get from having contact with a subject,
          which then requires either the teacher or the student to look for the
          blind spots and help with lingering questions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope this psychological insufficiency also puts a last nail on the
          methodologies coffin. Yes, there are better techniques for teaching
          &mdash; which vary according to different subjects, by the way
          &mdash;, and the last 2 centuries' methodologies have improved them a
          lot, however the diminishing returns on them don't justify at all
          their current importance and emphasis. There's a reason why private
          teaching is still the most primal and the most effective way of
          teaching.
