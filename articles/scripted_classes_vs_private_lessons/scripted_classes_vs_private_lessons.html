        A complete and thorough discussion on this topic likely demands and

        throughout this article.

      <p>
        Scripted classes and group classes are definitely not the same, but I'll
        use them interchangeably in this article. That's mostly because private
        lessons, in contrast, when done well, are not scripted, and obviously
        not in group.
      </p>

      <p>
        The numbering below does not reflect any hierarchy of values, it's just
        for reference purposes:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          The current situation of the educational system is
          <em>understandable</em> but not <em>acceptable</em>.

          <ul>
            <li>
              It's 2021 and we are still stuck with the same educational system
              and logic from more than about 200 years ago. Everyone complains,
              everyone criticizes it, and we still can't seem to move on.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every ounce of effort spent trying to change the current system
              from within might backfire into preserving it. I'm not saying it
              will, but how many people have offered valuable changes to the
              current system only for it to still stay mostly the same as it was
              more than a hundred years ago?
            </li>
            <li>
              My suggestion is simple: lean more heavily on using technologies
              to help diminish the amount of repetitive teaching, while saving
              the teacher's time to use in private lessons and invididual
              consulting.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The ability to record lectures diminishes the need for this repetitive
          task, which frees up the teacher's time, leaving more time for
          private, targeted tutoring.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Up to maybe the 1950s, this was not possible, but we have come a
              long way now. The internet now grants us access to content from
              around the world, not only what can be shipped; and software gives
              us many more functionalities, like forums, commenting, interactive
              problem solving, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Motivation has always been one of the major tasks of teaching.
          Mandatory lectures mask this, obfuscating the problem.

          <ul>
            <li>
              One of the major criticisms about leaning heavily on the recording
              lectures methodology is that the teacher now has to enforce
              students to watch the lectures, because, if they don't, then she
              will need to answer repetitive questions individually again and
              again. But allow me to reframe this objection: aren't students
              forced to watch lectures in the current system anyway? And isn't
              one of the most important aspects of teaching simply instilling
              motivation in students?
            </li>
            <li>
              Just like when discussing cryptocurrencies, every critique of this
              new approach seems to be, in reality, a critique of the current
              system. The lack of motivation in current students isn't inherent
              to students, it's just a problem the current system fails to
              address. More passive, scripted lectures, and more mandatory
              subjects won't make the situation any better; in fact, anyone with
              the slightest of experience in this system will agree it will
              likely only make it worse

        <li>
          Scripted or group lectures do not offer almost any value when it comes
          social interactions. Most social interactions derived from them happen
          afterwards, which could happen with recorded lectures anyway.

          <ul>
            <li>
              But what about the social aspect of being part of lectures? Well,
              that's as much bad logic as going to the cinemas for dating:
              you're not having almost any social interaction when all parties
              are individually focused. Most of the social aspect people
              remember coming from lectures actually come from
              <em>after</em> them, and that same conversation or interaction
              could happen if you had seen the lecture in video form,
              asynchronously. I do agree, though, that the social bond of live
              lectures, even online, tends to be much stronger than other
              options, but I don't believe it justifies its existence as the
              default mode of learning, or outweighs the negatives.

          The best professionals almost all had great close instruction and
          coaching.

          <ul>
            <li>
              To me, that's even a no-brainer when you analyze the best
              professionals in the market. Most of them have had great advisors
              or bosses in order to get to the top: master artisans don't learn
              everything from the ether. Even Mozart, likely the greatest
              musical genius, had the help of father, one of the greatest
              violinist of his time<foot-note

        <li>
          No amount of lecturing will ever address all individual perspectives
          and perceptions of a subject.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Paraphrasing it, that means we cannot address all the possible
              interpretations students will get from having contact with a
              subject, which then requires either the teacher or the student to
              look for the blind spots and help with lingering questions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The current trend of teaching methodologies is just another form of
          lecturing, which offer considerable diminishing returns when compared
          to private lessons.

          <ul>
            <li>
              And no, I'm not advocating for the total extinction of group
              lecturing, I'm just arguing that it should be a much rarer
              occurrence than it is now, its benefits are diminishing everyday,
              with new technologies.
            </li>
            <li>
              I hope this psychological insufficiency also puts a last nail on
              the methodologies coffin. Yes, there are better techniques for
              teaching &mdash; which vary according to different subjects, by
              the way &mdash;, and the last 2 centuries' methodologies have
              improved them a lot, however the diminishing returns on them don't
              justify at all their current importance and emphasis. There's a
              reason why private teaching is still the most primal and the most
              effective way of teaching.

        </li>

          Theory isn't enough, practice and constant feedback is what builds
          expertise.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Hasn't the pandemic proven that overemphasis on theory isn't
              enough to be able to solve a problem? Researchers argued for
              decades that gain of function research would help us prepare for
              pandemics, but it turns out that the risks outweighed the
              negaives. That's when theory and argumentation took over reality
              and experimentation. It's a lengthy topic, but it's clear that
              researchers' vanity and corruption &mdash; e.g. Peter Daszak and
              Ian Lipkin &mdash; had a huge influence in this last pandemic.

        </li>
        <li>
          Scripted classes are time-wise practical for the teacher but time-wise
          impractical for the student.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scripted classes create bad habits: scripted answers.

          <ul>
            <li>
              And they might also be at the origin of the test epidemic in our
              educational systems.

        </li>
        <li>Private lessons help avoid shame when making mistakes.</li>
        <li>
          Recorded classes and private lessons do not diminish the students'
          ability of posing questions.

          <ul>
            <li>
              That's because current online learning software lets students pose
              questions anyway.
            </li>
            <li>
              And software will even lower the burden on the teacher: no more
              need for always answering the same questions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Private lessons enable more targeted and motivated homework.

          <ul>
            <li>
              The student can ask to work on related projects with hopefully
              real interest, instead of the typical generic homework which do
              not appeal to no one.
