        <p>
          It's 2021 and we are still stuck with the same educational system and
          logic from more than about 200 years ago. Everyone complains, everyone
          criticizes it, and we still can't seem to move on.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most teachers I've asked about this topic actually agree with me, but
          what can they do, really? They are mostly cogs on the machine, and
          they all depend on this system for their livelihoods, so it's
          comprehensible when they can't or don't do anything about it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Giving out the same lectures year after year sets "understandable" as
          the ceiling for the situation of the educational system and teachers
          worldwide. And that's a really low bar if you ask me.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, maybe we are being too harsh, this problem really does seem
          very hard to solve after all, it really looks like the type of problem
          almost inherent to the fabric humanity. How else would we teach
          anything?
        </p>

        <p>
          Up to probably the 1950s, I would totally agree with the previous
          paragraph. Giving out the same lessons year after year did indeed seem
          to be an immutable property of life. But the ability of
          <em>recording lectures</em> changes everything. By recording lessons,
          we can eliminate the repetitive and boilerplate work, and focus on
          each individual student's questions and difficulties, the teacher's
          time isn't dumped into this unnecessary task anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the major criticisms about leaning heavily on the recording
          lectures methodology is that the teacher now has to enforce students
          to watch the lectures, because, if they don't, then she will need to
          answer repetitive questions individually again and again. But allow me
          to reframe this objection: aren't students forced to watch lectures in
          the current system anyway? And isn't one of the most important aspects
          of teaching simply instilling motivation in students?
        </p>

        <p>
          Just like when discussing cryptocurrencies, every critique of this new
          approach seems to be, in reality, a critique of the current system.
          The lack of motivation in the current students isn't inherent to
          students, it's just a problem the current system fails to address.
          More passive, scripted lectures, more mandatory subjects won't make
          the situation any better; in fact, anyone with the slightest of
          experience in this system will agree it will likely only make it worse
