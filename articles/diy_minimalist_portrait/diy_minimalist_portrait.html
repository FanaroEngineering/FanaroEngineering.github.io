      <h1>DIY Minimalist Portrait</h1>

      It is impressively easy to create a (digital) minimalist portrait, once
      you know what you do that is...
      <p>
        I've always wanted to do one for myself, but never knew how. It just so
        happens that I was watching
        <a href="https://twitter.com/danlovesadobe">Daniel Scott</a>'s

        when he mentioned the <em>Image Trace</em> feature.
      </p>

        Illustrator is supposed to create vector graphics for designers, the
        type of image that does scale when amplified or zoomed in, unlike PNGs
        and JPGs. Behind the scenes, vector graphic images are just recipes for
        the computer to draw what the designer intended, the image itself isn't
        there at all. Usually, only simple shapes and images are advisable with
        this kind of format, otherwise the recipe might get unbearably long.
      </p>

        For a minimalist portrait this is exactly what you want, since your face
        features a lot of shapes which can be reduced to circles, squares,
        triangles, etc. For example, it's easy to imagine your eyes being
        reduced to a circle inside a pointy ellipse.

        The steps to create the portrait are very easy<foot-note

        >, but it might not work very well depending on the picture you're
        basing it on. It's advisable to use a photo with good lighting and
        contrast, otherwise Illustrator won't be able to identify edges.
      </p>
      Try the following:
      <ol>
        <li>Open Illustrator on a new file.</li>
        <li>
          Place (File &rarr; Place or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) your image
          onto the file or canvas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on your image and, on the right-hand panel, click on
          <em>Image Trace</em> and select one of the modes for vectorizing your
          image.
          <ul>
            <li>
              There are several good options for this use case. The ones I would
              try first are: Low Fidelity Photo; 3 Colors; and Sketched Art.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Edit your image to your liking.</li>
        <li>
          Export (File &rarr; Export &rarr; Export Screens or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
          <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>) it as an SVG, PNG (preferably
          transparent) or JPG.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If I were you, I would copy-paste multiple times my own original picture
        and then create multple vector versions for comparison, always keeping
        the original for comparison.
      </p>

        Your image tracing might not come out 100% clean or as intended. You
        will probably need to trim or add a detail here and there, so it's very
        important to keep multiple iterations of your design during your
        process. Place them side-by-side so you can easily spot the differences
        and the progress. I'm making a copy of my project file
        <a
          href="http://fanaro.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/abstract_me.zip"
          >here</a
        >
        so you can take a look at my thought process.
