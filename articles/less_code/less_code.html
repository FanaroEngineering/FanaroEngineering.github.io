      <h1>"Less Code" Print Design</h1>

      <p>
        The quote in the design is heavily inspired by StackExchange user
        <a
          href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/6735/quentin-starin"
          ><code>quentin-starin</code></a

      <blockquote>
        <p>How many lines of code can a C# developer produce per month?</p>
        <p class="quote-author">If they are good, less than zero.</p>

        I hope he won't mind me stealing his quote, but I'm not earning a dime
        from it anyway. It isn't a direct translation either, I ended up
        adapting it.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first I wanted to put the quote and, right below it, a snippet of the
        dreaded

        <a href="https://bookstore.thefutur.com/">The Futur's prints</a

          text="Chris Do, The Futur's leader, also created a

        &gt;, of which I'm a big fan."
        ></foot-note
        >, I settled for something much simpler, and, perhaps, more elegant. The
        font I used is
        <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/futura-pt">Futura PT</a>, and it
        is freely available on Adobe Illustrator.

        <strong>The thumbnail of this article is getting cropped</strong> and I
        can't do much about it, or at least I don't care to. The real designs
        are below and they feature variations of two characteristics: having
        labels/watermarks; and having different proportions, either squared, 2x3
        or 3x2.

        The text is in pure white, however, it's considered better practice to
        use light grey instead because the contrast is usually too high. In The
        Futur's prints, I think the background is a slab of stone, so it
        actually looks kind of cool to have pure white. Anyway, if you would
        like to change the color, feel free to open the AI file and edit it
        yourself.
