      <h1>A Solution to Frauds in Digital (Electoral) Voting: Beyond Safety</h1>

      <blockquote>
        Quick Update (October 18, 2019): Recently, I found out that the system I
        had previously proposed here basically already exists and is currently
        under implementation all over the world. Its technical name is
        <em
          >End-to-End Verifiable Voting Systems (with optional Homomorphic
          Encryption)</em
        >. It is explained in this
        <a href="https://youtu.be/BYRTvoZ3Rho">Numberphile video</a> from 2016,
        featuring Professor Ron Rivest, one of the creators of the widely used
        RSA encryption paradigm.

      <p>
        Recently, and with reason, the debate around digital (electoral) voting
        has been receiving more and more attention, with the most important
        topic being the vulnerability of the information. To solve the problem,
        the vast majority of solutions essentially recommend going back to good
        old manual counting. But is it really better than what technology has to
        offer?
      </p>

      <p>
        What is going to be explained next is a possible solution: there is a
        way to use technology to solve the security issue, and go even beyond
        it, offering authenticity and accountability.
      </p>

      <p>
        This discussion is very analogous to the security problems posed by the
        internet not so long ago, digital frauds were big threats, and many even
        opted for leaving the virtual world due to the frustrations and thefts.
        The problem was, nevertheless, slowly, minimized, to the point where it
        has become something secondary and that happens automatically and almost
        completely in the backstage through modern security protocols. But what
        was the main reason for this progress? In short: cryptography. We have
        adopted a very secure method based on prime numbers which is, in
        practice, unbreakable, since the only way to decipher the information
        would demand astronomical computational resources &mdash; obviously,
        humans are a source of vulnerability that is still inherent. In an
        excessively succinct overview, the algorithm uses a public key, which
        cryptographs any information whose access should be restricted to the
        end-receiver; and a private key, with which the receiver will decode the
        message safely. The analogy widely used to explain this method is to
        replace the public key for a lock, and the private key for a regular
        key, one that, to be replicated, would require the god of all locksmiths
        to work day in and day out for ages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, related to the protection of the information, we have
        other problems, like authenticity, that is, to know if the sender of the
        public-private key combination is indeed who he or she claims to be.
        However, this was pragmatically solved with the advent of authentication
        institutes. As a curiosity, one minor concession on the safety of this
        algorithm must be made, related to quantum technology: if it is made
        possible on a larger scale, the encryption we use safely today could be
        cracked easily &mdash; not so minor a concessionâ€¦ although it could be
        argued that we would only need to adapt to quantum cryptography; there
        will always be the apocalyptical scenario where we lose all of our
        information without ever knowing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, with such a powerful tool in our hands, we can go back to the
        main topic and propose a solution to voting frauds. Initially, one might
        think cryptography would only help us with the problem of protecting the
        voting information, a measure which would not be enough to prevent
        voting frauds, since the government could simply erase all the content
        and replace it with something more agreeable with their intentions. But,
        as briefly mentioned before, authenticity is a possible attribute of the
        cited public-private key algorithm, in other words, it is possible to
        verify if the content being used is indeed the original. How would that
        be done in practice? Firstly, a more modern manifestation of the
        electoral documents would replace our classical ones: all the necessary
        documents would be encrypted with the public-private key pair; next,
        after the votes, the government would not only count them, much more
        than that, it would publish them, paradoxically, in a secret and
        transparent manner: roughly, an enormous worksheet with the data of each
        vote and voter, encrypted by the respective public keys, would render
        verification easy, accessible and safe for all, something inconceivable
        with the good old manual methods. In this situation, each citizen is
        expected to verify if his vote is indeed correct and, if there are no
        complaints, there is no fraud.
      </p>

      <p>
        To conclude the discussion, it is imperative to reiterate the motto that
        technology is nothing but a means, which, invariably, only substitutes
        an older one, thereby maintaining the same problems of human improbity
        of its predecessor. It is on us to not regress in face of a new
        manifestation of something negative but to adapt the innovative
        technology which, most likely, will provide newer and more efficient
        ways &mdash; and maybe even more effective, as in this case &mdash; of
        dealing with the persistent original problem.
