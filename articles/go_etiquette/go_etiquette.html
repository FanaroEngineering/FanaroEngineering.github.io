  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    I've made terrible mistakes over the years when playing Go. And the biggest,
    more important ones were not moves in games or tournaments, they were people
    mistakes. I've had my share of friendship-ending and friendship-building
    attitudes, and it's not nice to not have control over this topic. After all,
    our deepest dependency, since the beginning of the human race, has been the
    same<sup id="footnote-origin-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> other
    people, we depend on the relationships with them for healthy survival, both
    socially and psychologically, like it or not.
  </p>
  <p>
    We tend to focus too much on teaching and learning the game itself, without
    focusing at least a good portion of our time explicitly into the
    relationship topic. But, as this AI era might have taught you, without
    another person, the game can easily become void or much less meaningful, at
    least in comparison to what it can be as a social experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's where Go etiquette comes into play: it is a convention, a solution to
    avoiding bad human interactions and highlighting the good ones. And the
    solution part should be the main point whenever teaching one of these rules,
    because it's not about being pedantic or blindly following dogmas, it's
    about keeping people sane, it's about filtering nuisance, it's about
    avoiding probably the biggest evil of social interaction: shame<sup
      ><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    When teaching Go etiquette, the fundamentals are not the basic or most
    common rules but the explanations behind them<sup
      ><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup
    >. The explanations are the true dependency of the etiquette system; if you
    ignore them, the system won't be fully reproducible, there will be no taming
    it. If you can't explain the reason for each rule, you <em>will</em> find
    yourself someday in an unusual situation in which you will think you have to
    apply rule A when, in fact, you would have to instead apply rule B; and
    that's simply because the much more subtle core of the circumstances
    changed. This system isn't unlike Go, where we have a reasonably small set
    of proverbs but bluntly applying them can't get you past 10 kyu; knowing
    when and why apply a proverb is inextricably tied to why apply a proverb.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recently, I've been finding a lot of inklings of improvements to myself and
    the Go community by examining parallels to other related communities, like
    Jiu Jitsu. Probably my favorite unexpected source is Nick Albin's rambles on
    his YouTube channel,
    <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diTEcRp1aOg&amp;list=PL5awtUfQsILp7p59W5_z9g9Mjds88J9YR"
      >Chewjitsu</a
    >. The Jiu Jitsu community is much more socially developed than the Western
    Go community, there's been much more successful experimentation.

  <h2>2. Tips and Advice from My Experience</h2>

  <p>
    I currently have 8+ years of experience with this game (1-2 dan on KGS<sup
      ><a href="footnote-4">4</a></sup
    >), with a bonus of living and playing for 1 year in Europe &mdash; while
    studying engineering &mdash; and 1 semester in South Korea. Besides all that
    I have also practiced competitive swimming (4 years), competitive Water Polo
    (5 years) and Crossfit (1.5 year), so I do believe I have some depth when it
    comes to the practical part, even though I'm not a psychologist nor have I
    really reached the pinnacle in any of those sports.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless, more importantly, I have made a bazillion mistakes, so at
    least you will for sure learn a ton of the "don't"s from me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here go some of my most valuable tips, which you might find elsewhere, but,
    in my opinion, not with the same nuance, completeness or attention to
    pitfalls...

  <h3>2.1. When Playing Live</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Smiling and being open minded are probably the MVPs of etiquette and best
      practices. You can basically do everything else and yet people will
      probably prefer playing with an ignorant, smiling, happy player.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Oftentimes we don't realize we are treating the other badly. The best
          way of solving this problem is using the other's emotions as feedback
          on your attitude: try to make an effort of recognizing negative
          emotions on his or her face and, right then and there ask what is
          bugging him or her.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Research shows
              <a href="https://youtu.be/BkOIw7vAZCQ"
                >couples which try to defuse negative emotions the quickest are
                the happiest</a
              >, not those which try to avoid discussions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't make noises with your stone bowl while you're thinking.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Some people told me &mdash; hoping for an excuse &mdash; shuffling
              the stones calms them down. When it comes to etiquette your point
              of view is not enough for establishing a good practice or getting
              absolved. If something is a good practice for you but annoys<sup
                ><a href="footnote-5">5</a></sup
              >
              everyone else, please stop.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you feel like an attitude of yours or of someone else will or is making
      you ashamed, try your best to shake it off<sup
        ><a href="footnote-6">6</a></sup
      >.
      <a
        href="https://fanaro.com.br/on-korea-a-brief-summary-of-my-experience/#My_Choice_for_the_Main_Path"
        >Shame is also a social spiral</a
      >, people get ashamed for causing shame. Slowly, this contagiousness will
      annoy other people, and you might get labeled as the root.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't place-and-slide the stones, it's distracting and adds an unnecessary
      visual layer to your movement.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              And some people use it to cheat, since they can gather some info
              about where they will ultimately move the stone while watching the
              other player's facial expressions.
            </li>
            <li>
              I've seen people get really pissed at players who do this sort of
              thing in tournaments. And this was eventually officially banned in
              the <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?KPMC">KPMC</a> since 2017.
              And I really can't remember if I've ever seen an Asian pro doing
              it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Be objective and honest when reviewing games, without offending people.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Practice this carefully, we could write whole books about this topic.
          It is great when it goes well, but terribly awful when it doesn't.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Gently place stones, do not use too much force.
      <ul>
        <li>
          It's pleasant to clack the stones as loud as possible, but it's only
          pleasant to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          I don't think I have ever seen a single professional clacking stones
          loudly, be him or her Japanese, Korean, Chinese, American or European.
          That goes to show that, if you think clacking stones is the right way
          to go, you're probably actually wrong.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Respect handicaps at all costs, be disciplined about it.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The minute you go disregard handicaps is the minute you implicitly
          disrespect the other player, be him/her weaker or stronger. It might
          seem like a small thing sometimes, but it seeps into many other
          contexts. For example, it poisons the environment when you get into a
          review.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Even if you feel like the handicap is inaccurate, endure it. Next
              time, you can politely ask to readjust it; or use the rule of 3
              losses/wins in a row and it automatically changes, up or down.
              This discipline will dissipate the rank doubts in the long run.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Nigiri when players have the same rank.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Whoever wins this odds-or-even gets Black, it's not about choice
          actually.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're the stronger player, avoid playing more than one opponent at the
      same time.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unless they are explicitly ok with it, they will feel as if their time
          is not worth your full attention.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you win, wait for your opponent's &mdash; sometimes implicit &mdash;
      permission before starting the review.
      <ul>
        <li>
          That's how they do it in the
          <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?KBA">KBA</a> as far as I know. In
          fact, the implicit etiquette for Korean pro players is usually to let
          the loser speak for most of the review. Reviewing the game is seen as
          a way of coping with the loss apparently.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Sincerely thank your opponent for the game, specially if you win. Mean it.
      <ul>
        <li>
          This game is essentially mental fighting, so the same respect martial
          artists usually show for one another should be replicated to Go.
          <ul>
            <li>
              At least fighters can have their wounds on their bodies. Mental
              games overload the players' psyches.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      When commenting on the game don't use imperative sentences &mdash; e.g.
      "you should", "this <em>is</em> better", etc. &mdash;, prefer exposing
      opinions &mdash; e.g. "I think"/"I believe". Let the other player take
      what he wants from it, time and experience will tell who's right
      eventually.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the game is over, each player should count the opponent's points.
      <ul>
        <li>
          This way each player will extract the captured stones of their own
          color, which will avoid hand-bowl collisions when organizing things.
          Having people put stuff in your bowl feels like an overreach, since
          you develop a sense of property over them throughout the game. I know,
          I know, humans are weird...
        </li>
        <li>
          This one is a speculation of mine: I think that, psychologically, this
          reduces the likelihood of cheating as well. Most players tend to count
          much more often their own points than their opponent's, so cheating on
          the other player's counting process feels a lot shakier if you're
          gonna try it after the game ended and the shapes have been
          reorganized.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Preferably organize counted territories in pockets of multiples of 5.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Personally, I think that rectangular shapes work just as well, if not
          better. And, surprisingly, I haven't had any complaints, even from
          pros and high dan amateurs.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Multiplying the sides can be easier than recognizing multiples of
              5 in odd, weird shapes, though you will get accustomed to these
              weird but common counting shapes.
            </li>
            <li>
              My favorite counting technique is actually composing the whole
              territory into preferably only one giant rectangle. This way we
              have to perform only one multiplication to count the whole thing,
              instead of adding a ton of smaller pocket-sized territories, which
              also demands some memory. It's more efficient computationally
              actually, although it messes up the board more.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          This also goes for organizing the captured stones, both during and at
          the end of a game.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're both using a game clock, please be more patient and nicer than
      usual. An explicit clock puts even more psychological pressure into the
      game.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Online we don't even need to deal with the clock much, since it's
          automatic. Having to tap the clock physically is way more annoying
          than we might expect initially.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Unless you're dealing with a total beginner, don't call out ataris. For
      those who can recognize them, it's a very annoying interruption of the
      silent flow of the game when this happens.
    </li>
    <li>
      When transitioning between sequences in the review, recollect the current
      sequence's stones backwards so as to make the process clearer to everyone.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're the weaker player in the review, preferably, only expose your
      thoughts when the stronger player leaves a communication opening.
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the case of reviews, when I say stronger, I mean considerably so.
          Usually this means the stronger player is at least 3 stones up.
          Otherwise both players can come up with &mdash; relatively &mdash;
          valuable information quite often.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're the stronger player and you're not reviewing &mdash; probably
      because you're hurt from losing &mdash;, you're doing a disservice to
      yourself, the opponent and the community as a whole.
    </li>
    <li>
      AIs provide better options, not absolute answers nor explanations. A
      stronger player's move might have more value than the AI's simply because
      its explanation makes it more reproducible.
      <ul>
        <li>
          A technique that is not reproducible is more like a unique painting
          than a technique.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Using Black and White instead of pronouns and names can be positive with
      respect to making the review more objective. But using names and pronouns
      can also help bridge the brutal winner-loser dichotomy.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unlike the simplistic advice people give about being objective in the
          review, be mindful that there is no simple solution to this problem
          and that it is a very relevant one.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      When the game ends, please put the stones back into their respective bowls
      &mdash; after counting and reviewing.
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is probably the faux pas that makes more experienced players<sup
            ><a href="footnote-7">7</a></sup
          >
          the angriest, though almost always accidental.
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you want to go to the bathroom, either hold it in and quickly
              put everything in its place or warn the other player. Otherwise he
              or she will think you ran away expecting to skip organizing
              everything.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Get away from
      <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?HikaruNoGo">Hikaru no Go</a>'s
      mysticism.
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is mostly a beginner's problem, but sometimes you get a single
          digit kyu (SDK) still wrapped around this mindset.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's just a game, mate.
          <ul>
            <li>
              This dismissive statement doesn't defeat the purpose of this
              article actually. Etiquette and the game itself are basically
              media by which we interact; interactions which are far more
              important than the implementation details of the etiquette system
              or the game. The apparent paradox here is that we couldn't extract
              proper interactions without going through the less important
              interfaces of etiquette and the game itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              It can personally become something bigger, but it's a narrative
              you're gonna have to create for yourself, in a sane and healthy
              manner.
            </li>

              Maybe reading

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      When playing Pair Go, don't tell your partner where to play, be it
      implicitly or explicitly.
      <ul>
        <li>
          This one seems obvious because it's the most explicitly emphasized
          rule in Pair Go. But I think that, out of the close to 50 pair Go
          games I've played, maybe only once or twice have I played the full
          game without this happening.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't get mad if your Pair Go partner screws a sequence up.
      <ul>
        <li>
          It's understandable &mdash; though not easily forgivable &mdash; that
          you would get mad if a sequence you triggered gets destroyed by
          something that's out of your control, like your Pair Go partner.
          However, he or she is playing the best possible Go they can and, so,
          please squash your anger before any words come out of your mouth or
          any emotions pop on your face.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Put yourself in your partner's place. How is it acceptable to be
              mad at them in a situation where his or her best gets demoralized
              by a teammate who should be actually helping?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          This one reveals a total lack of team mentality. Being mad at your
          partner's screw up because it's the sequence <em>you</em> wanted to
          see happen is plain old selfishness, something that's easy for people
          to get addicted to since Go is individual sport.
          <ul>
            <li>
              And, ironically, the anxiety you will cause on your partner will
              increase the likelihood of a screw up.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If you're going to lash out on your partner, please do it in private
          so as to not cause too much shame on everyone.

      </ul>

    <li>
      Teach beginners often.
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you're not being nice to newcomers and helping them, you're being
          rude to the whole community.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many more experienced players try to avoid beginners because they are
          seen as a waste of time since there's such a colossal skill- and
          time-wise gap between them. However, every one of us was once a
          beginner; and just imagine the huge impact we could get from advice
          coming out of expert, black belt minds.
        </li>
        <li>
          And most people severely underestimate the value a beginner provides.
          Their minds are

          will unconsciously teach us how to think with a truly open mind once
          again.

  <h3>2.2. When Playing Online</h3>
  <p>
    Most of what was discussed in the previous section also applies to the
    online context, but here go some tips which are more specific to the online
    context:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Preferably say "hello" and "have a good game" ("gg").
      <ul>
        <li>
          It's basically the internet's &mdash; videogamey &mdash; version of
          <em
            ><a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Onegaishimasu"
              >onegaishimasu</a
            ></em
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Originally, "gg" was created with the purpose of resigning gracefully
          in the videogame Starcraft. However, this sort of expression is so
          simple and versatile that people, both in the Starcraft and Go
          communities, use it both at the start and beginning of games.
        </li>
        <li>
          99% of internet players view it as mandatory, but most of the more
          experienced players, including myself, view it as annoying
          boilerplate.
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you ask high dan players if they consider an opponent rude for
              not saying "hi gg" at the beginning of an online game, I bet on
              9:1 most of them will say something like "I don't care".
            </li>
            <li>
              This might seem contradictory to what was discussed at the
              beginning of the previous section. But not having the other player
              physically in front of you changes your experience. Personally, I
              think a decent attitude at the end of the game is much more
              important. And decent enough in this context can simply be silence
              in my opinion.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't forcibly play fast.
      <ul>
        <li>Put a lot of asterisks on this one for sure.</li>
        <li>
          Some players do play naturally fast, and I don't think there should be
          a problem with that. But I sometimes see online players trying too
          hard to play fast in order to destabilize the other player
          psychologically.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't <em>escape</em>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is a niche faux pas to KGS, where the platform allows for getting
          away of the game without resigning. Please don't ever do this, you
          will regret it, word gets around.
        </li>
        <li>
          Losing by time seems to make some people almost just as mad.
          <ul>
            <li>
              But I, again, don't get it. Specially if you've played some chess,
              you will realize that winning or losing by time is normal, you
              shouldn't care.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The argument against it revolves around the fact that the
                  loser wants to diminish the value of the win because then he
                  could excuse himself by saying that there wasn't enough time
                  to think. But the fact that there wasn't enough time almost
                  always implies that your opponent put you in a difficult
                  situation anyway, so all the merits to him or her.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      And don't get me started on some other people saying that
                      it will distort the way the game was won. For example, one
                      player could be losing by 100+ points and the final status
                      of the game would be "win by time". By this insane logic,
                      we would have to always go through the very end, because
                      simply resigning doesn't reveal any point-wise delta in
                      the scorecard anyway.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't be mad at last minute invasions, they are part of the game, part of
      life actually.
      <ul>
        <li>As you get stronger, they happen less and less.</li>
        <li>
          What is the problem with final Hail Mary's? If you have a winning
          position but a portion of your territory is iffy, there is no problem
          in your opponent questioning it.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The funny thing is that almost all DDKs and SDKs are totally
              dumbfounded when they ask a pro to review their games and the pro
              finds a million different ways of destroying their moyos.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          As a personal confession, I've once managed to lose a good friend,
          when I started playing Go, because he had the habit of last minute
          invasions. After a bad verbal fight, we never spoke again... I think
          we were both wrong in the end, but that won't absolve me anyway.
        </li>
      </ul>

  <h2>3. Some Extra Tips from Sensei's Library</h2>
  <p>
    The tips below are some pearls I've found scouring the
    <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Etiquette"><em>Go etiquette</em></a> page
    on Sensei's Library &mdash; I've also paraphrased some of the content.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      In simultaneous games, play your move when your opponent has reached your
      table, not while he is away.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Or at least point to the move when the more experienced player comes
          to your table.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Only take the stones off the bowl when you're ready to place them.
      <ul>
        <li>Please, keep your hands off the bowl 99% of the time.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep captured stones visible at all times.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It's very annoying to count the points when this doesn't happen.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tidy them in multiples of 5 too, just like when counting the
              points at the end of the game.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't play the first move in the corner closest to the opponent's bowl.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The usual take is actually for you to play the first move on the upper
          right. By stretching yourself into that corner you implicitly bow to
          the White player, which is historically the stronger one, usually the
          master<sup><a href="footnote-9">9</a></sup
          >.
          <ul>
            <li>
              However, from poking around with this rule, I realized that most
              people develop a sense of ownership for the corner that's closest
              to their own bowl, which might be to their left if the person is
              left-handed. To me, this unconscious tendency overrides the "<a
                href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?PlayingTheFirstMoveInTheUpperRightCorner"
                >play the first move in the upper right corner</a
              >".
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>4. Other Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    I will never be able to cover all of the possible variations: real-time
    interactions are too rich for me or anyone to prescribe them all completely.
    Humans will always come up with something creative and valid in the end<sup
      ><a href="footnote-10">10</a></sup
    >. The purpose of this article was to develop intuition about the rules from
    the reasoning behind them, so hopefully you will be able to categorize as
    correct or incorrect a variation of the behaviors mentioned above.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't let tradition hinder you, though. Those who choose to blindly preserve
    nonsensical conventions are not in-depth contextual thinkers<sup
      ><a href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup
    >. Traditions arose from, among many other factors, context and
    circumstances, we must adapt them when times change.
