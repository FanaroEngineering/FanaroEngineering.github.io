        Chinese game (~1725 A.D.):
        <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?LiangWeijin"
          >Liang Weijin (1680-1760)</a
        >
        (White) vs
        <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?FanXiping">Fan Xiping (1709-1769)</a>
        (Black). This is the description on Etsy:
      </p>

      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        Kiai! Originally an illustration to the French book "Les Chants de
        Maldoror" written by Le Comte de Lautréamont (1868), pseudonym of
        Isidore Ducasse. In the book the main character Maldoror takes on the
        form of a giant eagle to fight God, who is half dragon-tiger, half
        serpent. The board position is from a game from the 18th century between
        legendary go player Fan Xiping (black) and Liang Weijin (white), known
        as "nailing down the guoshou title".
      </p>

        Ever since buying the print design, I've been planning on creating a
        review for this, or at least mostly transcribing a professional review
        somewhere. However, so far, I haven't been able to find a professional
        review anywhere. So I had to resort to my 1-2d KGS monkey brain.
        Luckily, nowadays, we can also use super strong AIs to help us, and
        that's exactly what I did: besides my first unbiased review, I've used
        Leela Zero Big (ELO 16190 at 2k Variations) to help me specially with
        the more complicated moves.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        It should also be noted that having White start and no komi for
        <em>Black</em> really does distort Leela's plays, specially at near the
        end of the game. Leela might choose inferior moves because it wrongly
        thinks the advantage is bigger than it really is.

          on his channel</a
        >, which I think covers very well many of the more complicated parts of
        a game that is even more complicated than the one that's the focus of
        this post.

        I've used Sabaki to edit this game, so other editors might not display
        the same amount of metadata, including the one below.

      <h2>Historical Context</h2>

      <p>
        This is one of the games of the <em>Games of Wonder</em> book, by Jun Wu
        and Jiong Wu. This game is also known as
        <em
          >nailing down the
          <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Guoshou">guoshou</a> title</em
        >
        &mdash; Black 162 is seen as a nail, hence the pun &mdash;, because
        that's how Fan Xiping earned his. <em>Guoshou</em> means national hand
        or national treasure. Fan Xiping became <em>guoshou</em> at the age of
        16. Shi Xiangxia is also known as Shi Ding'an.
      </p>

      <p>These games are known for:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Crazy games with a lot of exchanges, groups and tenukis.</li>
        <li>
          The rules are not modern Chinese nor Japanese, but Ancient Chinese.
          <ol>
            <li>
              Each group has a 2-point penalty to it &mdash; actually it's more
              accurate to say:
              <em
                >if one player had more living groups than the other, then every
                additional group costs 1 stone (2 points)</em
              >.
              <ul>
                <li>A group must have 2 eyes to live.</li>
                <li>This incentivizes sacrificing and cutting groups.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Cross hoshis start.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It somewhat compensates for the advantage of having to play
                  first.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>White starts.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>From a Jubango &mdash; Best of 10 &mdash; they played.</li>
        <li>Ogeima and wide cross pincers were very common in the fuseki.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        There exists commentary of this game by the late legendary Chen Zude 9p:

          >Ancient Chinese Go Games with Detailed Commentary Series</a
        >, but the whole book hasn't been translated to English yet apparently.
