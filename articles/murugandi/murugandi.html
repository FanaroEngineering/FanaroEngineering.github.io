        The design above, called <em>Fighting Spirit</em>, by
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/murugandi/">Murugandi</a
        ><foot-note text="Murugandi's real name is Kim Ouweleen."></foot-note>,
        features a very famous ancient Chinese game: Liang Weijin (White) vs Fan
        Xiping (Black). This is the description on Etsy:
      </p>

      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        Kiai! Originally an illustration to the French book "Les Chants de
        Maldoror" written by Le Comte de Lautréamont (1868), pseudonym of
        Isidore Ducasse. In the book the main character Maldoror takes on the
        form of a giant eagle to fight God, who is half dragon-tiger, half
        serpent. The board position is from a game from the 18th century between
        legendary go player Fan Xiping (black) and Liang Weijin (white), known
        as "nailing down the guoshou title".
      </p>

      <p>
        Ever since buying the print design, I've been planning on creating a
        review for this, or at least mostly transcribing a professional review
        somewhere. However, so far, I haven't been able to find a professional
        review anywhere. So I had to resort to my 1-2d KGS monkey brain.
        Luckily, nowadays, we can also use super strong AIs to help us, and
        that's exactly what I did: besides my first unbiased review, I've used
        Leela Zero Big (ELO 16190 at 2k Variations) to help me specially with
        the more complicated moves.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        It should also be noted that having White start and no komi for
        <em>Black</em> really does distort Leela's plays, specially at near the
        end of the game. Leela might choose inferior moves because it wrongly
        thinks the advantage is bigger than it really is.

        Another quite helpful resource was
        <a href="https://youtu.be/AxYdz6MJKCM?list=WL"
          >Murugandi's review of Fan Xiping vs Shi Xiangxia<foot-note
            text="Shi Xiangxia is also known as Shi Ding'an."
          ></foot-note
          ><foot-note
            text='This game is part of the &lt;a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?TenGamesOfDangHu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten Games of Danghu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.'
          ></foot-note>
          on his channel</a
        >, which I think covers very well many of the more complicated parts of
        a game that is even more complicated than the one that's the focus of
        this post.

        I've used Sabaki to edit this game, so other editors might not display
        the same amount of metadata, including the one below.
