            text='Murudandi&apos;s name origin: &lt;em&gt;When I started playing 
            go in September 2004, I needed a nickname for the Kiseido Go Server. 
            It was to be no more than 10 characters long for the online login and 
            I came up with Murugandi. This was a combination of "Murugan", 
            the name of an elephant in the Artis zoo in Amsterdam that I lived closeby 
            to, and "Gandhi" without the H. It was not for any particular 
            reason that I chose two Indian names, I just liked the way it sounded.
            Later I found out that Murugan is the name of a Hindu deity, the god of War. Mahatma Gandhi is an icon of peace in world history. So Murugandi is a purely coincidental mix of war and peace: the perfect metaphor for the game of go.
            The name stuck and I started using it for my art as well.&lt;/em&gt;'

          Chinese game (~1725 A.D.):

          (Black). This is the description on Etsy:
        </p>

        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          Kiai! Originally an illustration to the French book "Les Chants de
          Maldoror" written by Le Comte de Lautréamont (1868), pseudonym of
          Isidore Ducasse. In the book the main character Maldoror takes on the
          form of a giant eagle to fight God, who is half dragon-tiger, half
          serpent. The board position is from a game from the 18th century
          between legendary go player Fan Xiping (black) and Liang Weijin
          (white), known as "nailing down the guoshou title".

          Ever since buying the print design, I've been planning on creating a
          review for this, or at least mostly transcribing a professional review
          somewhere. However, so far, I haven't been able to find a professional
          review anywhere. So I had to resort to my 1-2d KGS monkey brain.
          Luckily, nowadays, we can also use super strong AIs to help us, and
          that's exactly what I did: besides my first unbiased review, I've used
          Leela Zero Big (ELO 16190 at 2k Variations) to help me specially with
          the more complicated moves.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          It should also be noted that having White start and no komi for
          <em>Black</em> really does distort Leela's plays, specially at near
          the end of the game. Leela might choose inferior moves because it
          wrongly thinks the advantage is bigger than it really is.

          >, which I think covers very well many of the more complicated parts
          of a game that is even more complicated than the one that's the focus
          of this post.

          I've used Sabaki to edit this game, so other editors might not display
          the same amount of metadata, including the one below.

        <custom-h2 text="Historical Context"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          This is one of the games of the <em>Games of Wonder</em> book, by Jun
          Wu and Jiong Wu. This game is also known as
          <em
            >nailing down the
            <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Guoshou">guoshou</a> title</em
          >
          &mdash; Black 162 is seen as a nail, hence the pun &mdash;, because
          that's how Fan Xiping earned his. <em>Guoshou</em> means national hand
          or national treasure. Fan Xiping became <em>guoshou</em> at the age of
          16. Shi Xiangxia is also known as Shi Ding'an.
        </p>

        <p>These games are known for:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Crazy games with a lot of exchanges, groups and tenukis.</li>
          <li>
            The rules are not modern Chinese nor Japanese, but Ancient Chinese.
            <ol>
              <li>
                Each group has a 2-point penalty to it &mdash; actually it's
                more accurate to say:
                <em
                  >if one player had more living groups than the other, then
                  every additional group costs 1 stone (2 points)</em
                >.
                <ul>
                  <li>A group must have 2 eyes to live.</li>
                  <li>This incentivizes sacrificing and cutting groups.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Cross hoshis start.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    It somewhat compensates for the advantage of having to play
                    first.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It is also related to symmetry. Yin-Yang philosophy was so
                    important to China that it even seeped into Go. It is also
                    said that it represents the alternating 4 seasons, and that
                    Black and White would represent night and day, respectively.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>White starts.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>From a Jubango &mdash; Best of 10 &mdash; they played.</li>
          <li>Ogeima and wide cross pincers were very common in the fuseki.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          There exists commentary of this game by the late legendary Chen Zude
          9p:

          apparently.
