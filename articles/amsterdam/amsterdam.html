      <h1>My Brief Trip to Amsterdam: Red Lights, Go and Biblical Flirting</h1>

      <p>
        The winter in Brussels was finally ending and my mood would start to get
        a lift soon, but a project due in about 10 days was poking my brain so
        hard I could not help but feel stressed and angry. The stress was not so
        bad, after all that time fighting for a degree in engineering I was used
        to having a barely sketched project just one or two days before the
        deadline. The tough aspect of the whole situation circled around the
        attitude of my partners; I was the only one who had made something work
        by then and it did not seem to activate one single neuron of guilt or
        gratitude of my Belgian or Chinese colleagues. They surely had their
        chores and tasks to do, but you cannot use that as an excuse to the
        100-page manual of an electromagnetic simulator written in an old
        programming language. I was starting to believe they had implicitly
        quit, something I would later learn is even a legal term, and my plans
        on going away, more specifically to Amsterdam, were, out of
        helplessness, rapidly gaining life again.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day later and I was already inviting my friends to come with me to
        the city well-known for its red-light district, but they would all
        refuse, blaming it on similar projects and study sessions. The need for
        traveling was much bigger than the one for friends though, and I decided
        to go anyway. The distance was short and I would be there for one or two
        days only, I hoped it wouldn’t be that much of a problem. Actually, I
        hoped it would be that much of a problem, I wanted my diminished efforts
        to incite my colleagues to do something &mdash; and it worked… sort of.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few days later I wake up excited for the trip but get a quick slap to
        the face from looking at the typical concrete cloudy day in Brussels;
        even though I love its people and the overall feel of that city, I must
        confess they should do something about their background, just freaking
        shoot some fireworks or give free LSD injections to the people already.
        Gray is the color only the English and the Belgians can live by, I won’t
        ever understand &mdash; I once made that remark to a Belgian and he said
        he had not realized such lack of sunlight until I had stated it. After
        consulting the weather forecast app on my smartphone, I find out that,
        luckily, it will be sunny in Amsterdam the whole weekend, so let’s cheer
        up and get to the station.
      </p>

      <p>
        The start of the trip is at the Gare du Nord­ &mdash; North Station
        &mdash; in Brussels, which is a copy of a station in Paris… or in
        London… or maybe it’s an original bruxelloise piece of architecture,
        since the biggest aspect of the city’s beauty is the mix of different
        types of works, a phenomenon, called brusselization apparently, that
        only works there, or at least according to the locals. Anyway, it
        doesn’t really matter, I guess, not to me, and seemingly not to the
        Belgians either, since they put their red-light district right next to
        the station. Weird. Upon visiting their red-light district once &mdash;
        to know what the fuss was all about with these human meat displays
        &mdash; I saw some families with children getting out of the station and
        having to deal with the explicit show across the street; a friend of
        mine even told me she had to go through that street every morning when
        going to school. And they say the Germans are the weird ones. On the
        other side, we find a more sober lane, where sleepy students and low
        budget travelers find their universal solution for the transport problem
        in northern Europe: the Megabus. It goes everywhere for at most the
        price of two big cheap meals, close to 20 euros. You could easily get
        one to Amsterdam for 5 euros or less if you monitored the prices and
        promotions on their site &mdash; which I didn’t though: I was feeling
        more like a rich bitch and didn’t bother to pay the steep fee of 12
        euros. Probably the main problem we humble bus travelers face there
        nowadays is with these European stations: due to the ever higher
        salaries, there are less and less people taking care of them, so it’s
        very confusing to know exactly where to go, or if the bus is late or
        not, you have to rely on being deceivingly empathetic with strangers,
        especially with compatriots &mdash; Brazilians are everywhere… &mdash;,
        to be sure not that you’re in the right place, but that you’re not the
        only one hopelessly lost. This time, it was more or less ok, a slightly
        late bus, some hours of mild discomfort and we arrived.
      </p>

      <p>
        As usual, these international buses do not get exactly to the main city,
        sometimes it’s a peripherical neighborhood, like in Brussels, but this
        time it was in a place that reminded me of the stereotypical zombie
        movie. Sloterdijk is a station that seems, at least from the outside, to
        have been built to support a gigantic flow of people, but what I
        witnessed was a billion bicycles, the chilling noise of chains in the
        wind and the bus passengers rushing for the station. Inside, though, the
        plot was as expected from a train station, it was full of people. Some
        minutes later, I finally arrived at the center of the onion that is
        Amsterdam.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every time I visit a new city I like to wander around, get lost in its
        charm. And this time was something very special, very different, the
        architecture felt cozy, although it bestowed a paradox on the capital:
        the clash between its cosmopolitan routine and the tiny buildings and
        village houses was made with a steep and yet unnoticed transition. This
        contradiction is mainly due to historical reasons as usual; the houses
        we see today stayed, the rhythm changed. That type of architecture
        reminded me of my trips to England, Germany and especially Antwerp.
        Belgium, albeit a single country, is in reality two different societies,
        with two different languages also, and one can sense a very sharp
        transition when crossing the middle and passing into the Flemish side.
      </p>

      <p>
        In southern Europe, the rules are, from my experience,
        anthropomorphically seen as annoying bureaucrats, these necessary evils;
        but in that region of Europe, more specifically the former region of
        Flanders, they take a whole other level, I dare say they are their
        sovereigns, their deities, not only respected, but a source of strange
        devotion. This worldview yields a strange flow to society, the beauty of
        everything working properly is something foreign to people who come from
        Latin countries, here things are a lot messier.
      </p>

      <p>
        After all these observations, I realized I was in fact lost &mdash; to
        err is human, I guess. Being relatively tired, I decided to go to the
        place I would stay in for the next two nights, which I chose because it
        was the cheapest and most different: a catholic hostel in Amsterdam.
        They did not disappoint me, upon entering it I was confronted with a
        mass made by a young priest and his even younger assistants, which were
        from all over Europe. Right next to the small ritual was the diner where
        God Almighty friendly snacks and meals were prepared by a team of young
        apostles of the McDonald’s doctrine; their chief of staff managed to
        fuse together the figures of both the ruthless boss and the forgiving
        father, a slap-and-kiss master. I left my bags in the typical hostel
        bedroom full of people snoring and quickly exited the sacred place,
        definitely wanting to go the red-light district after the catholic
        relapse &mdash; one needs to balance one’s touristic diet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, I would get lost many times before arriving in the famous show
        streets of Amsterdam. But it was nonetheless pleasant, this time I was
        able to enjoy the historical center with its ornamented historical
        buildings, which felt timeless and powerful, a deeply ingrained image in
        my memory I associate with efficient work. Half an hour later and
        finally we are there, the legendary red-light district. And… nothing.
        Disappointing. It was bound to happen of course, after all I didn’t like
        the Brusselian version. It just seems so odd this ultimate
        objectivization of the sexually desired… Would you like to fuck a doll?
        No? How about a doll that kind of dances? Still nope. Never have I
        witnessed such indifference as the one in the eyes of the young
        prostitutes on the other side of those shop windows. These districts
        were originally an attempt to concentrate all the prostitution in one
        place, to ease policing the crime scene origins of society &mdash; which
        was very successful and spread throughout Europe &mdash;, but nowadays
        it feels like a food court, with most of the establishments going for
        the fast food approach, even though they do not quite understand that it
        should be a different business model: it should also be quick and
        expensive in their opinion apparently. In Brussels, the prices were at
        its cheapest 40 euros per 15 minutes with a lot of restrictions and a
        room that seemed too tiny for two people not to suffocate &mdash; I
        guess that if you book more than 15 minutes, that’s what will start to
        happen. The only ones taking the deal, both in Brussels and Amsterdam,
        were mostly Arab immigrants who apparently were so in need of a sexual
        companion, anything seemed to work. The government programs of social
        integration in Europe work in mysterious ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        After roaming around looking for entertainment, I headed back to the
        hostel, praying for some sweet catholic silence. In a room filled with
        16 people, the odds were against me. Scratch that, they actually wanted
        to punish me: the only guy snoring was the one right next to me. I tried
        to kick him softly just so he would turn sideways and hopefully stop the
        musical act, but it didn’t work, he was playing Peter on me. Luckily, I
        was getting so tired, I soon fell asleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next day I woke up earlier than usual (who knows why?). During last
        night my college colleagues eventually came out of hibernation and
        started to try to decipher the code I had written &mdash; nothing
        spectacular, my lines had only the basic features of a simulation
        working. I helped them through my phone but didn’t pay too much
        attention. This morning, on the other hand, I tried to compensate by
        spending some time making it easier to understand, before I went out to
        explore the city again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blessed breakfast, clean conscience and off we go. First stop, the Anne
        Frank museum. I didn’t get a chance to go in, too big a line, maybe next
        time. Next stop, my typical favorite, the public library. This one was
        huge compared to the size of Amsterdam, I think it had 7 floors, in a
        complete maze. They were inspired by their city’s paradox and created
        another one, because there were signs everywhere and I was lost every
        time, and worse: I couldn’t find most of the books. Resigned, I settled
        for a weird chair in a corner and made a point of finishing my
        <em>L’écume des Jours</em>. It took me some hours and some nearby
        coffee, but I made it, not an easy read for my level of French at the
        time, however, quite enjoyable, one of the best books I’ve ever read for
        sure.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last stop of the day would be related to my Go passion, the game
        that gave me a lot of entertainment and a lot of friends. I could not
        miss a taste of the Amsterdam’s style of Go, especially considering many
        of the older strong European players came from there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like most of Europe, they would gather in bars &mdash; something I had
        come to love, since it lightens the sometimes tense atmosphere &mdash;,
        although it wasn’t exactly a bar. People could play in the bar, but the
        serious fighting happened in the back, in a very dark room. Upon
        entering it I had the impression the Inquisition had used that same room
        to interrogate sinners &mdash; the wallpapers seemed medieval, dark red
        and gold ornaments drawn repeatedly on all walls &mdash;, a tense
        atmosphere of people eager to smash their opponents suffocated you and
        the clacking of stones pumped your heart to a racing pace. I sat down in
        a chair and my legs frantically bounced up and down as if indeed I were
        racing, one of my characteristic tics. The club’s leader told me I could
        play in their weekly league and so I accepted, registering myself as a 1
        kyu. My match would be against a 2 kyu and, to my surprise, the format
        had me giving him 2 handicap stones with komi in my favor, a very
        unusual setting. In spite of having an hour of main time, I knew I was
        bound to suffer, giving a 2 kyu such a board advantage was a first for
        me. Time for some special tactics: trick play after trick play and I
        started to gain an edge, the byo-yomi almost gave me a heart attack and
        a misread could have stolen me the win. Thankfully, my opponent did not
        see it, and I won by more than 15 points.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, the frightening part was the beginning, to remain calm
        against that never before experienced obstacle. Later, my opponent
        pointed out that, had we finished the game a bit earlier, we could have
        gotten a review from veteran Rob van Zeijst 6d, a pity it didn’t happen.
        Overall, it was quite fun, but I was relieved I could exit the dungeon.
        Next, I ate, drank some beer, and went back to the hostel: my colleagues
        were finally getting something done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prayer in, prayer out, and I was always there, watching with the
        omnipresence of my online chat. Despite bonding and getting some work
        done, we couldn’t get much further from my initial lines, only the most
        rudimentary simulation was working. There was an external attempt at
        helping us with some mysterious Chinese code, but, alas, it was a fake,
        it did not work. Late into the night and I was the only one left in the
        lounge area. Except for the janitor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unexpectedly, the janitor was about my age and female. After an hour of
        boredom and my furious concentration on the task, she asked me what I
        was doing. I tried to answer in a nonchalant manner to convey that I
        wasn’t really wanting to chit-chat, but, damn, being a janitor late at
        night is too lonely a job, she just couldn’t stop talking &mdash; and in
        a very thick English accent, something I wasn’t used to. You’ll find
        that a British expat girl working as a janitor in exchange for a place
        to stay and food in a catholic hostel in Amsterdam is very likely to be
        needy, as she suddenly stole my computer, lied down on my lap and
        started to show me nonsensical videos on Youtube. Surprised and not
        knowing what to do, I followed along her monologue, and her intentions
        were becoming more and more clear &mdash; both to me and to her. Soon
        after, though, my declaration of disbelief in any superior beings gave
        her a sigh of sadness, nevertheless she wouldn’t quit so easily. She
        manufactured a bible out of nowhere, opened it in a random page and read
        the fateful line: For one man has faith to eat all things while another,
        who is weak, eats only vegetables (Romans 14:2; apparently, not all
        bibles have this line, only some versions of the English one have it, I
        believe). I couldn’t help but give it a good and resounding laughter.
        Who knew vegetarians were bullied even back then? Having many vegetarian
        friends made it even funnier. The Brit, unfortunately, did not share my
        sense of humor, she was quick to scorn and give me goodbye.
      </p>

      <p>
        With owlish eyes, in a room full of people snoring, after being expelled
        from the lounge due to the late hour, little did I suspect the
        assignment that worried me for so long would be cancelled by the
        professor on Monday, arguing that nobody had managed to complete it.
