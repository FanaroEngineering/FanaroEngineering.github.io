        I used to laugh at Twitter and its users. The concept of trying to
        discuss under the limitation of 280 words per tweet seemed ludicrous to
        me<foot-note
          text="Until the end of 2017, it was 140, which was&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse."
        ></foot-note
        >. And it still does actually.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, now, after more careful deliberation, I can recognize two very
        powerful aspects of the app: <strong>sharing</strong> and
        <strong>connecting</strong>.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4QZ_LsYcvcq7qOsOhpAX4A"

        made a very comprehensive and jaw-dropping video on Twitter, which you
        can check out
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8N0xN0ihMA">here</a>. In that
        video, he mentions that the initial turning point for Twitter was
        realizing its potential as a <strong>news</strong> platform.
      </blockquote>

        Due to the limitations of size, those who decide to
        <em>share</em> information there will inevitably have to use much more
        concise and summarized words. Thus, Twitter ends up being probably the
        biggest redirecting resource on the internet right now &mdash; excepting
        Google, of course &mdash;, because people solve the message length
        limitiations by sharing links to where a more in-depth discussion of the
        topic can be achieved. And this is actually great, it is in fact an
        amazing alternative approach to <em>indexing</em> the internet and human
        thought, very different from classical indexers such as Google: who
        wouldn't want to have a list of summaries and snippets created by their
        favorite authors and thinkers? &mdash; This sort of credibility does
        make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may still not think that the idea is that good, but it has been very
        effective. It's one of the oldest and biggest modern digital media
        companies today, with more than 13 years of existence &mdash;
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">founded in 2006</a>.
        And, despite the sharing, the main reason for its success, in my
        opinion, is, in fact, the connecting. Through Twitter, you will be able
        to mention your personal idols and icons, and they will listen! Ok, if
        they are too famous, they might not, but you'll be surprised to know
        that they usually want to: it's good for their publicity, and they're
        humans too! They do want human contact, they want to talk about stuff,
        they do have interests. In my case, for example, I have managed to be
        able to get responses from very famous experts in my professional field
        who I would have never been able to reach otherwise<foot-note
          text='E.g.
        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin"
          &gt;Robert C. Martin (@unclebobmartin)&lt;/a
        &gt;
        and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck"&gt;Kent Beck (@KentBeck)&lt;/a&gt;.'
        ></foot-note
        >. This connecting effect is so powerful that, surprisingly, even
        experts from lofty fields such as Data Science and Machine Learning use
        it as a tool of keeping up with their peers and sharing content.

        Recently, after finding out about all this, I've decided to
        (re)enter<foot-note
          text="I had created an account in 2014 actually, but had never tweeted anything."
        ></foot-note>
        Twitter with a more specific purpose than simply spewing out whatever
        came to my mind. I'm gonna try to make my account and the platform more
        useful to anybody &mdash; even for myself, since it will act as a
        registry and a timeline of my own thoughts &mdash;, I'll share only
        things I deem worthy of anyone's time, stuff I'm learning about everyday
        and find enlightening, charming, educational. I've shared some of my
        tweets in this post which, hopefully, will convince you that my tweets
        may indeed be worthwhile or, at the very least, interesting.

          I think that an improved and more accurate version of this saying
          would be like:<br /><br />&quot;In school, though sometimes in a
          complicated manner, you arrive at a solution in a straight path;
          while, in life, it will much more likely take you dozens or hundreds

          These ancient philosophers just can&#39;t stop...<br /><br />[Favorinus

          Do as Diogenes did: he was unwell on one occasion when someone gave
          him a shove and put him in a headlock. Instead of engaging the man in
          a wrestling match, he (...) showed him his penis, and said, ‘Try, sir,
          to wrestle me to the ground by applying pressure to this.’

          For the low standards of videogame adaptations into series and movies,
          The Witcher on Netflix is a great achievement.<br /><br />But
          character developments are rushed, dialogues are uninteresting,
