      <h1>Laziness vs Eagerness in Dart</h1>

      <p>
        This article is inspired by some of the weirdness we faced when
        developing my and Marcelo's immutable collections package,
        <local-link
          text="Fast Immutable Collections (FIC)"
          link="../fic/fic.html"
        ></local-link>
        package. Both the examples in the first section were actually created by
        <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg">Marcelo Glasberg</a>, all I
        did was add some more explanations and rice them up.
      </p>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Why should anyone care?"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          What's discussed in this article is specially relevant if you happen
          to "mix" <code>Iterable</code> and <code>List</code>,
          <code>Set</code>, etc. Mixing those types can be useful, for example,
          when you have an object that could accept more than one type of
          collection. At any rate, many other reasons, as well as pros and cons,
          will be discussed throughout the article.
        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="Number of Evaluations"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          If I presented you with the following code, what would your
          expectations be? What would be your bets for each of the counters'
          values?
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Note the <code>.where</code> method returns an <code>Iterable</code>,
          even when applied to a <code>List</code> or <code>Set</code>.
        </blockquote>

        <pre><code class="dart">var lazyCounter = 0;
var eagerCounter = 0;

var lazyOddFilter = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].where((i) {
  lazyCounter++;
  return i % 2 == 0;
});

var evenFilterEager = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].where((i) {
  eagerCounter++;
  return i % 2 == 0;
}).toList();

print("\n\n---------- Init ----------\n\n");

lazyOddFilter.length;
lazyOddFilter.length;
lazyOddFilter.length;

evenFilterEager.length;
evenFilterEager.length;
evenFilterEager.length;

print("\n\n---------- Lazy vs Eager ----------\n\n");

print("Lazy: $lazyCounter");
print("Eager: $eagerCounter");

print("\n\n---------- END ----------\n\n");</code></pre>

        <p>Do the results below suprise you?</p>

        <pre><code>Lazy: 21
Eager: 7</code></pre>

        <p>
          How would you go about explaining them, even if you did get them
          right?
        </p>

        <p>
          Quite frankly, I would bet 8:2 you got it wrong &mdash; as did I
          &mdash; at least on the first try. The language used in the example
          also contributes to the misunderstanding: who wouldn't simply
          trivially assume that the eager version would <em>not</em> be the one
          overdoing things?
        </p>

        <p>
          The reason for what happened above comes from the fact that the lazy
          filter actually doesn't return a thing, it returns an object that
          carries the operation to return a thing. So, every time you really
          want to know the result of the operation, the lazy object has to
          (re)evaluate the operation, it has no memory and it doesn't evaluate
          the operation at first. The eager version, on the other hand, does
          everything right away and does remember the results.
        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="Evaluation Order"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          Ok, that was weird. But, most of the time, performance isn't really
          the problem, specially since computers have got so fast<foot-note
            text="Oh, have they really?"
          ></foot-note
          >. Debugging and readability tend to be much more relevant and
          recurrent problems during development. So why should we care?
        </p>

        <p>
          The <em>when</em> things happen can affect the <em>order</em> in which
          things happen. Debugging will certainly be more difficult if you're
          not aware of what's happening when, and readability will suffer if
          what you write doesn't clearly represent 100% of what's going on.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's take a look at the following example. Try predicting the order
          in which each method will be called in each case:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="dart">int eagerCounter = 0;
int lazyCounter = 0;

List&lt;int&gt; removeOdd_eager(Iterable&lt;int&gt; source) {
  return source.where((i) {
    eagerCounter++;
    print("removeOdd_eager");
    return i % 2 == 0;
  }).toList();
}

List&lt;int&gt; removeLessThan10_eager(Iterable&lt;int&gt; source) {
  return source.where((i) {
    eagerCounter++;
    print("removeLessThan10_eager");
    return i &gt;= 10;
  }).toList();
}

Iterable&lt;int&gt; removeOdd_lazy(Iterable&lt;int&gt; source) {
  return source.where((i) {
    print("removeOdd_lazy");
    lazyCounter++;
    return i % 2 == 0;
  });
}

Iterable&lt;int&gt; removeLessThan10_lazy(Iterable&lt;int&gt; source) {
  return source.where((i) {
    print("removeLessThan10_lazy");
    lazyCounter++;
    return i &gt;= 10;
  });
}

var list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15];

print("\n\n---------- Init ----------\n\n");

Iterable&lt;int&gt; eager = removeLessThan10_eager(removeOdd_eager(list));

Iterable&lt;int&gt; lazy = removeLessThan10_lazy(removeOdd_lazy(list));

print("\n\n---------- Lazy ----------\n\n");

print(lazy);

print("\n\n---------- Eager ----------\n\n");

print(eager);</code></pre>

          You can run all the code from

            link="lazy_vs_eager_test.dart"
          ></local-link
          >, but, long story short, you will realize from the log above that the
          eager version of the compound operations above will first solve all of
          the inner operations and then pass everything to the outer function;
          while the lazy version will do things only whenever they're needed.
          All that means is: if you're going for the lazy version, when
          debugging, you might end up with logs and results of both functions
          mixed together, which will very likely make things more difficult to
          solve. Lazy functions and methods are much more easilly debugged
          atomically than when put together with other lazy abstractions, but
          that's only my opinion, maybe you will develop different intuition
          with respect to this topic.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Laziness seems to have been historically very appealing to academia
          and mathematicians. Typically, those individuals don't care much about
          <strike>concrete results</strike> numerical results, only that their
          <em>shapes</em> are correct. For instance,
          <em>functional</em> languages, like Haskell, are lazy by default.

        <custom-h2 text="The Weird World of Iterables"></custom-h2>

        <custom-h3 text="The Pros and Cons"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          After all of that headache you might have had reading the last
          section, you might be thinking: why in the world would someone even
          use laziness, it complicates things so much...
          <foot-note
            text="What actually really complicates things is mixing laziness
            with eagerness."
          ></foot-note>
          However, it has its use cases.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simplest use case to justify laziness is obviously not having to
          calculate stuff up front. Imagine you want to deliver the user the UI,
          making only the necessary calculations. If your language doesn't
          programmatically support laziness, you will have to manually monitor
          every single entity to ensure it is so. But, if you were working with
          <code>Iterable</code>s or in Haskell, you would be sure it had not
          been triggered unless totally necessary. Flutter isn't really
          technically a lazy framework, but its declarativeness does offer many
          of the same features.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pagination is yet another use case. Through the pagination mechanism,
          you ensure that only the data that fits the user screen &mdash; or
          whatever UX you're delivering &mdash; will be queried and delivered.
          For that, overarching the design with <code>Iterable</code> might be
          the way to go.
        </p>

        <p>
          That all being said, I really do think it is better to discourage the
          default use of <code>Iterable</code>s. Since it is very unlikely that
          you're going to perform an operation on a sequence only once, it is
          much wiser to use <code>List</code> as the default than the other way
          around.
        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="Infinity and Databases"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          One of the beauties of laziness is that infinity becomes a feasible
          abstraction. For example, modeling a list that's tied to the database
          could become much more seamless because querying would then be done
          on-demand, there would be no need to recreate the iterable for every
          batch, i.e., the iterable itself &mdash; partially &mdash; represents
          the connection to the database.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Dart, infinite <code>Iterable</code>s are also called
          <a href="https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#generators"
            >synchronous generators</a
          >, but, if you're going for something asynchronous, you could use
          <code>Stream</code>s. In fact, the on-demand, potentially infinite
          connection to the database in Dart is done through streams on top of
          socket layers.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="dart">/// On-demand generator.
Iterable&lt;int&gt; naturalsFunc() sync* {
  int k = 0;
  // Infinite loop!
  while (true) yield k++;
}

var naturalsIter = naturalsFunc();

print("\n\n---------- Init ----------\n\n");

print("The infinite list/iterable was created, but not evaluated.");

print("\n\n--------------------\n\n");

print("\n\n---------- takeWhile ----------\n\n");

print("It's possible to work with it,"
    "but it's necessary to add a method to "
    "stop the processing at some point");

var naturalsUpTo10 = naturalsIter.takeWhile((value) =&gt; value &lt;= 10);

print("Naturals up to 10: $naturalsUpTo10");

print("\n\n---------- END ----------\n\n");</code></pre>

        <custom-h3
          text="One of The Main Benefits of Implementing
          &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt;:
          &lt;code&gt;for (... in ...) {}&lt;/code&gt;"
        ></custom-h3>

        <p>
          One of the most mundane but very practical benefits of implementing
          <code>Iterable</code> is the possibility of iterating over it through
          the very readable <code>for (... in ...) {}</code> pattern. It seems
          very minor, but readability improves dramatically with it, and it is
          totally worth it taking the time to implement <code>Iterable</code> or
          any of its subclasses, if you're at a low dependency level in your
          application that is.
        </p>

        <p>
          That being said, if you end up having to implement any of
          <code>Iterable</code>'s gigantic interfaces, it will surely come in
          handy to be aware of some built-in Dart <code>mixin</code>s, like
          <code>IterableMixin</code>, <code>ListMixin</code>,
          <code>SetMixin</code> and <code>MapMixin</code
          ><foot-note
            text="I know, I know, &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; doesn't
            implement &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt;, we're gonna discuss
            that later."
          ></foot-note
          >. Choose the most specific <code>mixin</code> out of them, because
          each of them feature appropriate implementations for each of their
          default respective targets.
        </p>

  print(value);
}</code></pre>

        <custom-h3
          text="&lt;code&gt;Iterator&lt;/code&gt; and
          &lt;code&gt;EfficientLengthIterable&lt;/code&gt;"
        ></custom-h3>

        <p>
          Most of <code>Iterable</code>'s core methods will internally create an
          <code>Iterator</code> to handle their logic. For example, the
          <code>length</code> method has to iterate over the whole iterable to
          finally compute the collection's length.
        </p>

        <p>
          As you might have already realized, that isn't very efficient. That's
          why Dart features the

          >
          <code>abstract class</code>, which is supposed to be implemented by
          classes that offer a more efficient way of calculating the
          <code>length</code> of collections, like <code>List</code> and
          <code>Set</code>.

        <custom-h3 text="Tail Call Optimization (TCO)"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          One of the main problems with (ab)using recursion in most programming
          languages is that, when disassembling the recursion stack, the
          language will create whole layers for each of its stages, when most of
          them might just be plain return calls or very simple computations.
          This can easily cause memory leaks for complex computations, and some
          languages &mdash; specially functional ones, like Haskell, which
          doesn't even feature loops, only recursion<foot-note
            text="Can loops be totally be replaced by recursion? What is the
            Venn diagram here? &lt;a&gt;Here is the answer&lt;/a&gt;."
          ></foot-note>
          &mdash; have implemented ways of compiling only the necessary
          operations to have the recursion going, and that feature or abstaction
          is typically called <em>Tail Call Optimization (TCO)</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          So... does Dart feature TCO?
          <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/66356967/4756173"
            >I've asked about it on StackOverflow</a
          >
          and fortunately got an answer from
          <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2156621/lrn">lrn</a> himself,
          one of the main developers of the Dart language at Google.
        </p>

        <p>
          Long story short, Dart doesn't support the feature and there are no
          plans of incorporating it. And that's apparently very much due to
          JavaScript. Nevertheless, there's an
          <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1159"
            >ongoing, open issue on Github</a
          >
          about it.
        </p>

        <custom-h3
          text="Why Dart chose &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt;
          for its design (not a complete answer)"
        ></custom-h3>

        <p>
          Again,
          <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/52353197/4756173"
            >according to lrn</a
          >, the answer seems to be that, mainly, having an overarching
          interface for many collections helps in satisfying design constraints,
          if the programmer ever faces them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides that, I personally believe that a lazy layer is easier to
          implement underneath an eager one than the other way around.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyhow, I was still curious about why Dart chose this specific design.
          Is there something I'm missing here? I ended up asking
          <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/66356823/4756173"
            >another question on StackOverflow</a
          >. This time I got some more info, like the fact that, had
          <code>MapEntry</code> been around before or at the creation of
          <code>Map</code>, then maybe <code>Map</code> would have been an
          <code>Iterable&lt;MapEntry&gt;</code>, I'm not sure. Anyhow, I'm still
          not 100% convinced I know the answer to the questions surrounding this
          topic &mdash; and I apparently don't even know how to ask the question
          either, given the feedback I've received so far.
