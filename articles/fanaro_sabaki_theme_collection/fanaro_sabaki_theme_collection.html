        This article is mostly a pointer to the hopefully

      <p>
        The idea behind that package came to me after getting tired of looking
        at the mostly same design in multiple Go editors. It seemed to me a
        waste of potential to have the malleability of software and stay stuck
        with the same standard design from hundreds of years ago, if not
        thousands. This is an old idea of mine but I didn't quite have the
        know-how to pull off anything against it until a few years ago, and then
        it was a matter of battling laziness and finding an editor which allowed
        its user to mess around with its design. Luckily,
        <a href="https://sabaki.yichuanshen.de/">Sabaki</a>
        fits the bill.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most important point, at least initially, of the repo is to
        experiment with very basic variations on the design, developing
        benchmarks for what is visually pleasant or not. The reason this is so
        crucial is due to the natural counter-attacks you will get when
        presenting them as ideas to your fellow Go players: they will very
        likely strikethrough any "weird" ideas<foot-note
          text="Obviously, there will be wiser, more reasonable players 
          willing to experiment."
        ></foot-note
        >. Now, you can show this repo instead, and end the prejudice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creating a new theme is not at all hard with Sabaki. There are 4 basic
        ingredients to it:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><code>packages.json</code></strong
          >: where you store the theme's metadata, and a pointer to the style's
          file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><code>styles.css</code></strong
          >: where the styling of your theme happens. Here you will point to
          your media assets, as in stones, goban, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Media Assets</strong>: you will need to create images for the
          stones, goban, background, etc. You can use any image editor &mdash;
          e.g. Illustrator, GIMP, Inkscape, Photoshop, etc. &mdash; to do this,
          these are simple images<foot-note
            text="I don't know if there's support to SVGs, but I don't think so."
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Packaging</strong>: use
          <code>asar pack &lt;folder&gt; &lt;theme-name&gt;.asar</code> to
          package your theme into an <code>asar</code> file, which is what's
          accepted by Sabaki as a theme. You will need to install the
          <code>asar</code> tool with NPM first, of course.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The easiest way of creating a theme, though, is to copy one of the many
        available in my repo and then modify it as needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        What might not be so easy to do is to tinker with some more specific and
        unusual elements. Apparently, Sabaki does allow it, you can check out
        more about it in
        <a href="https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki/issues/789">this issue</a>,
        or in the documentation itself. An example of modifying the grid color
        can be seen in the image below:
