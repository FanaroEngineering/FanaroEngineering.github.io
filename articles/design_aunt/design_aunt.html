      <h1>Print Designs for My Aunt</h1>

      <p>
        In reality, this one didn't please me very much. I think this challenge
        was mostly a bit beyond my current abilities, since I'm still more or
        less a beginner and don't really know how to hand draw. But, anyway,
        here's what I have:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Flowers Original Image Trace-100.jpg"
          class="design-fragments"
        />
        <figcaption>The original picture, with Image Trace.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Flowers Variation 1 Square (Black)-100.jpg"
          class="design-fragments"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Probably my favorite out of all. With a transparent background, I can
          see this as a legit logo or something you would be able to incorporate
          into many other (personal) designs. The only issue I would try to
          correct is making the bottom line less straight, it seems very abrupt
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Focused Flowers Square (Black)-100.jpg"
          class="design-fragments"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Again, the bottom line seems a bit abrupt, but the flowers are really
          the highlight of the original picture.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Flowers and Background (Black)-100.jpg"
          class="design-fragments"
        />
        <figcaption>
          The background is supposed to be transparent. The idea would be to
          have the flowers transition into the background via the natural
          perspective effect.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="No Street (Black)-100.jpg" class="design-fragments" />
        <figcaption>
          The perspective transition doesn’t look so natural here, but it’s an
          option depending on the context.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="Final Black & White Squared-100.jpg"
          class="design-fragments"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Black & White portrait almost entirely coming from Illustrator’s Image
          Trace. I only cleaned it a bit to make it look more smooth.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="Final 16 Colors-100.jpg" class="design-fragments" />
        <figcaption>
          Colored portrait almost entirely coming from Illustrator’s Image
          Trace. I only cleaned it a bit to make it look more smooth.
        </figcaption>
