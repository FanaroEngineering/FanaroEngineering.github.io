      <h1>The Insufficiency of the Right (and, therefore, of the Left?)</h1>

      <p>
        Insufficiency regarding what? It could be related to many aspects,
        however, this discussion will be restricted to a criterion that usually
        benefits nations broadly: economic growth. There will be no fooling
        ourselves, though, that economic growth automatically grants us with
        absolute progress and happiness, nonetheless, it can be observed that it
        correlates considerably well with better living standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        To alter the direction of the economy, both the Right and the Left have
        numerous mechanisms, but the essence orbits around the fundamental
        question of wealth distribution. The Left defends, almost always, an
        explicit and forced redistribution of income, which manifests itself,
        also almost always, through government programs; while the Right defends
        the opposite, an absence of such programs, equipping themselves with the
        argument that the economy would have self-regulation mechanisms
        embedded, and artificial controls would cause malfunction and
        inefficient behavior. This liberalist rhetoric has its roots in the
        works of important philosophers and economists such as Adam Smith and
        Friedrich Hayek, but would a free market really be the best path for the
        economy?
      </p>

      <p>
        What has been seen throughout the last 40 years is a no – the
        philosophers of the past oversimplified reality; just as we abandoned
        the erroneous ideas about physics of the ancient Greeks, we should do
        the same with those of the more recent philosophers also. The two main
        evidences which attest these excessive simplifications are two extremely
        important statistics: the world’s GDP growth; and wealth concentration
        (which is deeply correlated with income inequality, the more common
        statistic).

      <p>
        According to the graph provided by <em>The World Bank</em>, it is
        possible to conclude that neoliberal policies widely implemented since
        the 1970s &mdash; facilitated by and together with globalization &mdash;
        have completely failed to maintain or increase the world’s economic
        growth &mdash; with an honorable mention to the only negative point of
        the graph, thanks to the close to effectively inexistent stock market
        regulation in the USA (and in the world generally) a bit before 2008.

      <p>
        The second statistic is, nonetheless, more relevant and frightening. As
        reported by the <em>World Economic Forum</em> &mdash; since 2015 &mdash;
        the planet has reached the impressive record of at least 99% of the
        world’s wealth being concentrated henceforth in the hands of only 1% of
        the population, with the tiniest detail: half of humankind will own less
        than 0.7%. But, although this statistic is indeed something negative,
        what would be its relationship with the whole economy? In a simple
        explanation, this disparity in the distribution ends up by drastically
        shrinking the global consumer market, in other words, without buying and
        selling, capitalism does not work.
      </p>

      <p>
        These last data set the grounds for the reasoning behind the graph that
        synthesizes the insufficiency of the Left and the Right as economic
        guidelines: economic growth vs social inequality. Its construction has
        taken a long time to be accepted by the economists, nevertheless, its
        logic is very easy to understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, imagine a society in which all the income is concentrated in the
        hands of a few &mdash; a scenario analogous to the medieval age &mdash;,
        it is then not so difficult to realize that economic growth would be
        close to zero, after all there is no buy-and-sell mechanism. Now, let us
        focus on the other end of the graph, where economic equality is complete
        and absolute: intuitively, there would also not be much economic
        advance, after all, the absence of meritocracy would not reward the
        above the average effort of any individual &mdash; note that, in this
        hypothesis, there would still be growth: as long as there are people who
        like what they do, there is no absolute need for extra
        benefits<foot-note
          text="Illogically, many arguments of the Right against socialism 
          &mdash; and justifications of its failure &mdash; are based on 
          individual morosity when these are faced with such a reduced 
          meritocracy. However, aside from a lot of (unpaid) meritocracy 
          having existed in the late USSR, the main reasons for its failure 
          have actually no link with socialism itself, but are, in general, 
          also common to capitalism: governmental corruption, excessive 
          military spending, low social improvements and strong external 
          pressure from the other economic system, namely, capitalism. 
          Considering its extreme adversities, one could even say that USSR’s 
          socialism was even more successful than capitalism in the rest of the 
          world."
        ></foot-note
        >. Finally, after anchoring the extremes of the graph as close to zero,
        we can go on to the most important part: is there an optimum of economic
        growth? To answer this question, a mix of common sense and evidence is
        necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we implement meritocracy on both extremes, be it by rewarding more
        even or unevenly, the buy-and-sell mechanism is reactivated, and, thus,
        economic growth gets a boost. Logically, as there are almost zeros on
        both sides and we know that economic growth can be bigger than zero,
        this implies that, somewhere in the middle, there is at least one peak
        or optimum. The doubt about the uniqueness of this point of maximum has
        not yet been resolved by the scientific community, still, there is
        already an overwhelming amount of clues indicating it is indeed unique.
        Many studies, models and statistics reveal that incrementing the income
        of the wealthier part of the population ends up diminishing the pace of
        the economy (a 1% increase of the income of the top 20%, reduces growth
        by at least 0.08% in 5 years, according to the International Monetary
        Fund<foot-note
          text="Note that even an institution historically classified as 
          liberalist and right-wing in the past is now defending income 
          redistribution policies. The IMF is, after all, more practical than 
          ideological."
        ></foot-note
        >), while the same differential applied to the poorer population, on the
        other hand, results in helping growth<foot-note
          text='&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2015/06/15/how-inequality-affects-growth"&gt;The Economist: How Inequality affects Growth&lt;/a&gt;'
        ></foot-note
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        After establishing the graph’s shape &mdash; an inverted “U” or a
        parabola with a downward concavity &mdash;, we can at last discuss the
        problematic dichotomy of the Right and Left. Both sides err because they
        do not optimize economic growth &mdash; advocating, in reality, zeros as
        ideals &mdash;, be it by the absence of meritocracy or by an indirectly
        verified extreme wealth concentration. However, given the reality, the
        mistake of the Right is harder to forgive: to defend (neo)liberalism
        after consciously knowing the aforementioned statistics is nothing less
        than promoting poverty and strengthening even more the power of the
        rich<foot-note
          text="The rise of poverty is predictable in the short-term, 
          nevertheless, in developed economies, there is, actually, only a 
          bigger income disparity, that is, the lower class has increasingly 
          better living standards, while the riches of the upper class 
          increases at a much higher rate."
        ></foot-note
        >. With respect to the Left, due to the general global panorama, its
        existence is, perhaps, justifiable, as it acts essentially to balance
        the power between the rich and the poor; yet, it is imperative to
        realize that its existence is, in absolute terms, also insufficient to
        guarantee more progress to society.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, how can we change the economic prognosis to something healthier?
        Briefly, the primordial is the focus on the more pragmatic, an ideology
        which would prime for efficiency and not for the Left or the Right,
        i.e., if one day we happen to be closer to the leftmost extreme of the
        graph (and to the left of the optimal point): that even the supposedly
        leftists advocate for less income redistribution! There is no more room
        to accept incomplete or flagrantly wrong theories, formulated in an era
        when there were not enough data to assuredly prove them<foot-note
          text="The liberalist theories, for example, have recently been 
          suffering considerable blows from Nobel prize psychoeconomists 
          laureates, who have demonstrated that the market and the people do 
          not function as they once were idealized. On the other side, there 
          is also the unrealism of socialism, which forces equality on beings 
          that are, inherently, different."
        ></foot-note
        >. Let us not have government policies guided by extremist theories and
        discussions, but pondered by facts and data, under the much more
        important criteria of pragmatism and efficiency &mdash; in Brazil,
        especially today, after such delusion with both sides of the biparted
        politics, we might finally have the unique opportunity of rooting out
        this dichotomy once and for all<foot-note
          text="The opposition between the Right and the Left, in thesis, 
          should help us with a dialectic that would create a more complete 
          middle ground, however, it seems like humans cannot come out of 
          these extremes so easily, a permanence which is already lasting more 
          than approximately 150 years!"
