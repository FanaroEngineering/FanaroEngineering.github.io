        Quote #3 - Martin Fowler on Good Code (and engineering in general)
      </h1>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good
          programmers write code that humans can understand.
        </p>
        <p class="quote-author">
          Martin Fowler,
          <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler"
            >Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, 1999</a
          >.

        Even though you might admire the elegance of code which uses the
        extremely succinct \(i, j, k, \mathrm{fft}(x)\)... notations for
        variables and assignments, the truth is they are incredibly difficult to
        manage in a larger-than-one-file codebase. And that's not because that
        math is complicated but rather because you're fooling yourself for
        thinking that making an abstraction visually succinct will make its
        complexity disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just because the letter \(i\) is smaller than the words "row" or
        "column" doesn't mean your brain will automatically attach meaning to
        it. In reality, every time you try to understand code with this sort of
        scientific notation, in your head, you will try to associate the symbols
        to their meanings, which creates a ton of mental friction when trying to
        understand the whole. So why not simply write "row" instead of this
        dreaded \(i\) and eliminate the friction altogether?<foot-note
          text='I
        know, I know... there are times when a row becomes a column later on,
        and, so, writing "row" might be confusing. In those cases, sure, choose
        another name &mdash; please still try to avoid the letter extremely
        succinct names like &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;. But, until then, stick to the
        simpler "row".'

        I would add to Fowler's quote that we should not only write code that
        humans can understand but rather understand it easily. Developing with a
        team in a codebase where every line contains a bit of mental friction is
        not only unpleasant but unsustainable. Mad looks, wtfs, anger and
        resentment will quickly get even bigger than the code itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quote above can also be further generalized into the importance of
        not only taking care of the what &mdash; the product itself &mdash; but
        the how &mdash; the means. If, for example, you want to develop a wheel,
        ideally, you wouldn't have to also develop a vehicle, like a car, in
        order to test it. You would simply create a rod you could spin and
        attach it to the wheel. This equipment would be you taking care of the
        most optimal way of how to develop the wheel, which, arguably, is a
        product in and of itself, a metaproduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing a vehicle to test the wheel may <em>seem</em> like good
        enough. It tests the product in the end anyway, doesn't it? But it's
        much worse than you would initially believe it to be. One big reason is
        that it creates a multivariate issue, i.e., you're not testing the wheel
        in isolation anymore, you're testing the whole system; so, if something
        isn't playing out as expected, how would you unambiguously say it's due
        to the wheel and not any other part of the vehicle?
      </p>
      <p>
        The other reason &mdash; and the one that is much closer to Fowler's
        quote &mdash; is that it adds a lot of noise, inconvenience and useless
        stuff to what you want to test. Imagine the routine of someone who wants
        to test the vehicle-wheel setup: every day the person would have to make
        the whole thing work in order to test even the smallest of the parts. If
        the setup were simpler, the management cost would be that of only a
        simple rod.

        And all this discussion is, to me, (at) the heart of engineering. After
        bashing my head against many walls throughout the past years, I've come
        to firmly disagree with blunt definitions like the one propagated by the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"
          >American Engineers' Council for Professional Development</a
        ><foot-note text="On Wikipedia at least..."></foot-note>, where the
        product is the centerpiece, the objective. Developing the quick and
        dirty version of a product is much easier than you would think and you
        will be appalled by how demotivated you will feel about it. Instead,
        engineering is actually about the means of production &mdash; seems
        oddly familiar, doesn't it? Try imagining modern capitalism without
        engineering...<foot-note
          text="I'm not a
        defender of capitalism, I'm just throwing facts where they are due."
        ></foot-note>
        &mdash;: watch your quick and dirty innovative product be surpassed in
        the long run by "copycats" who did the same thing as you but with better
        <em>means</em>.
