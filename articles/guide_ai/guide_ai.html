      <h1>A Guide to Go AI Programs</h1>

      <p>
        In this post, I’ll be teaching you how to install the main AI Go tools
        of today, at least the freely available ones. These are very valuable
        items to have at your disposal &mdash; after all, who wouldn’t like to
        have AlphaGo reviewing your own game? 🙂 &mdash;, and they do not take
        that long to install. This guide is composed of 4 tools with different
        objectives and different pros and cons:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Leela, to analyze games and play against an AI;</li>
        <li>
          Lizzie, to analyze games on the spot (without registering the
          variations);
        </li>
        <li>
          Leela + Sabaki (and the ELF and PhoenixGo versions), to play against
          an AI and make them play against each other;
        </li>
        <li>
          Go Review Partner, to analyze games in more detail and in a more
          automated manner.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <p>
          Leela<foot-note
            text="The name Leela comes from a character of the animated sitcom 
            Futurama, a girl who only has one eye."
          ></foot-note>
          is the most famous item of this list, since it is available from even
          before the Deep Learning storm. It was created by the Belgian
          scientist<foot-note
            text="Who I never happened to meet, even though I lived for a year… T.T"
          ></foot-note
          >, Gian-Carlo Pascutto, who, originally, worked with chess. After
          AlphaGo, Pascutto was one of the quickest online creators to make a
          new artificial intelligence utilizing Deep Learning available.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are two versions of the program, one that contains AlphaGo’s
          basic algorithm <a href="https://sjeng.org/leela.html">Leela</a>, and
          another, which has the latest version of the algorithm, starting from
          scratch, without any prior knowledge of Go:
          <a href="https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero">Leela Zero</a>. For those
          who don’t know much about this branch of Go, I would suggest
          downloading Leela and playing with it for a bit, the interface is
          quite complete and its level is around 9d KGS, i.e., extremely strong,
          just as good as a strong insei at least<foot-note
            text="Insei is a Japanese Go term for those who train and study to 
            become a professional Go player. "
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Leela Zero is an under-construction project. Despite
          <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/">Deep Mind</a>'s last
          article’s algorithm &mdash; in which AlphaGo Zero learned, by itself
          and from scratch, to become even stronger than its last version in
          only about 8 hours<foot-note
            text="You can also learn a bit about the opening with the tool 
            AlphaGo Teach. The only warning is that the tool does not use 
            AlphaGo Zero, but AlphaGo Master, its penultimate version."
          ></foot-note>
          &mdash; being elegant and simple, calculating the tuned parameters
          would take approximately 1700 years<foot-note

          with an average (not so average actually) computer. To produce AlphaGo
          Zero, Google utilized special hardware for a more efficient
          computation of tensors, with GPUs specialized in Deep Learning that
          cost millions of dollars. To try to replicate the weights of the
          neural network, Pascutto created a sharing system where each user can
          help with his or her own computer. Since the project is not yet
          finished, if you wish to use Leela Zero, you will have to use a
          graphical interface, which we will discuss later on.

        </figure>

        <p>
          This is a graphical interface which makes studying with AIs much more
          pleasant.
          <a href="https://github.com/featurecat/lizzie">Lizzie</a> uses Leela
          Zero to generate candidates for the next moves, while showing live
          variations, besides a graph of the winning percentages. Some of the
          most useful commands are:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>X for showing the commands menu;</li>
          <li>Space for turning the pondering on and off;</li>
          <li>O for opening SGF files;</li>
          <li>
            A for starting the autoanalysis and specifying the number of
            variations per move.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Although very pleasant and powerful, Lizzie doesn’t solve the demand
          problem completely. There are still some imperfections. The biggest
          flaw would be not having a way to save the variations in the SGF file
          or even being able to recover them while running the program, this
          problem with recording makes the software a bit impractical for some
          purposes. Fortunately, this last issue can be solved in a very
          automated way with another tool, the Go Review Partner.

        <custom-h2 text="Leela + Sabaki (ELF + PhoenixGo)"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          <a href="https://sabaki.yichuanshen.de/">Sabaki</a
          ><foot-note
            text="Sabaki is another Go term, which designates the settling of 
            a weak group inside the opponent’s sphere of influence, through 
            light and flexible moves."

          is one of the most modern Go editors nowadays. The software was
          focuses in customization, better feel and the contribution of the
          community. The code is open source, anybody can create new themes,
          there are new editing tools, the variations tree is vertical and, more
          importantly, there is an integration with executables of AIs. Through
          this software, we can play against AIs and make them play against each
          other.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before we continue with the implementation, we must first download the
          essential files. An AI is composed basically of two files: its
          executable, which contains the algorithm; and its text file, which
          contains the calculated parameters of the neural network<foot-note
            text="Try imagining a neural network as a human brain. Its 
            executable would be the hardware and the connections between the 
            neurons, while the text file with the weights or parameters of the 
            network would be analogous to memories and experience. Without the 
            text file, it would be as if we were starting from zero ground."
          ></foot-note
          >. The executable which I recommend is the one inside Lizzie &mdash;
          I’ve tried others, but only got errors. As for the text file with the
          weights, there are several options.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first one is to directly download
          <a href="http://zero.sjeng.org/best-network"
            >the best Leela Zero weights</a
          >, also found in
          <a href="https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero"
            >Leela Zero’s GitHub Page</a
          >, under the section <em>I just want to play right now</em>. The other
          is to go where they are actually stored. In the site dedicated to
          Leela Zero, we can find an enormous number of its versions, in each
          line of the tables, the strength being roughly proportional to the
          product of the dimensions of the column Size. According to
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfmbgDBr2m7k-676AIzJgYQ"
            >Igo Baduk Weiqi</a
          >, the 128×6 versions would already be strong enough to give me (1d
          KGS) 3 handicap stones. However, the fun doesn’t end there. On the
          table to the right, at some point, we will encounter, with bold
          percentages, a version with the numbers 83% (this number might change
          in the future); this is the winning probability of these weights
          against the best Leela Zero version.
        </p>

        <p>
          How is that possible? That’s the iteration created by
          <a href="https://research.fb.com/facebook-open-sources-elf-opengo/"
            >Facebook: ELF</a
          >. If you wish, you can download its weights directly
          <a
            href="http://zero.sjeng.org/networks/62b5417b64c46976795d10a6741801f15f857e5029681a42d02c9852097df4b9.gz"
            >here</a
          >. After downloading the files, let’s finally get to the
          implementation…
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many possible configurations in Leela’s implementation, but
          I will only show here what worked for me &mdash; obviously, feel free
          to test others<foot-note
            text="There are other commands such as “–heatmap” and “–flat” that 
            I will not discuss here, see Leela Sabaki’s GitHub page for more info."
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon opening Sabaki, go to <kbd>Engines</kbd>
          <kbd>Manage Engines...</kbd>, click on <kbd>Add</kbd> and name the AI
          you’re going to implement. Below, you will either type the path to the
          AI’s executable (<kbd>.exe</kbd>) or simply click on the folder symbol
          and point to the file directly. Next, on the next line, we will need
          to to provide some specifications for the simulation, besides the path
          to the text file with the weights (to find the path you can simply
          click on the path bar from Windows Explorer; but keep in mind that you
          should avoid paths that use spaces). What worked for me was:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="bash">--gtp -w C:\Users\Philippe\Desktop\GoAI\elf_converted_weights.txt -t 2 --noponder --timemanage off</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          If you have additional GPUs, you can include the command
          <code>--gpu 0</code> or <code>--gpu 1</code>:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="bash">--gtp --gpu 0 --gpu 1 -w C:\Users\Philippe\Desktop\GoAI\elf_converted_weights.txt -t 2 --noponder --timemanage off</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Lastly, it is necessary to place the initial commands of the
          simulation. What I use is simply the time configurations for each
          move. The second parameter of this command is probably the most
          important, informing the amount of seconds for each play, therefore;
          if we wish to make the AI think for only 5 seconds, we will have:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="bash">time_settings 0 5 1</code>
        </pre>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Voilà! We now have our first pet AI (maybe two if you’ve also
          implemented Facebook ELF). To use them, you only need to go to
          <kbd>Engines</kbd> > <kbd>Attach...</kbd> and click on the arrows
          right next to Black and White.

        <p>
          There is still another AI that deserves some attention:
          <a href="https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo">PhoenixGo</a>. At the
          beginning of this year, surprisingly, we had a different AI winning
          the <em>World AI Go Tournament 2018</em> PhoenixGo, from
          Tencent<foot-note
            text="Tencent is a giant Chinese conglomerate, most notably, in 
            the internet market. It owns QQ and WeChat, very big and popular 
            communication services in China."
          ></foot-note
          >, dethroning Fine Art (also from Tencent; PhoenixGo was most likely
          only created so they could win the tournament) and Leela Zero. You can
          find its
          <a
            href="https://github.com/yenw/LeelaZero_PhoenixGo/releases/download/v1/leelaz_win_x86_cpu.exe.zip"
            >executable</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://github.com/yenw/LeelaZero_PhoenixGo/releases/download/v1/PhoenixGo_v1.txt.gz"
            >text</a
          >
          files
          <a href="https://github.com/Tencent/PhoenixGo/issues/35">here</a>.
          PhoenixGo is the AI which runs the fastest and smoothest among the
          ones I’ve tested so far, but, actually, it doesn’t seem to be the
          strongest (perhaps Leela Zero has improved a lot since its loss in the
          world championship?). Apparently, among the three, ELF is still the
          strongest AI.

          The objective of
          <a
            href="http://yuntingdian.com/goreviewpartner/grp-documentation/doc.htm#game-review"
            >Go Review Partner</a
          >
          (there is also a
          <a href="https://github.com/pnprog/goreviewpartner">GRP GitHub page</a
          >) is to automate the AI analysis process. The standard output of the
          software is, however, an <code>.rsgf</code> file and not a
          <code>.sgf</code> file, as usual. The <code>.rsgf</code> standard was
          created to handle files <code>.sgf</code> files which have a very big
          amount of variations, leading to big and almost intractable variation
          trees. The GRP itself is able to open them, but, if you want, there
          are two alternatives. The first one would be to open them with another
          program, <a href="http://www.ruijiang.com/multigo/">MultiGo</a
          ><foot-note
            text="MultiGo is one of the oldest SGF editing software, and one 
            of the most complete, although the aesthetics are not very charming."
          ></foot-note
          >; and the second would be to convert the <code>.rsgf</code> file to a
          <code>.sgf</code> one through the GRP.
        </p>

        <p>
          To use the software, you’ll first need to have
          <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a> installed. Pay
          attention, though, to the version you’re installing because the more
          recent ones will yield errors. Only the 2.7.X versions will work
          properly (I use the 2.7.13, for example). If you have Windows, you
          only need to download the <code>.msi</code> file and continue the
          installation process normally. If you have another operating system,
          installing the <code>TkInter</code> library is necessary, which can be
          achieved through a command like:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="bash">sudo apt-get install python python-tk</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Next, inside Windows, after downloading one of the
          <a href="http://yuntingdian.com/goreviewpartner/">packages</a>
          containing an AI, you will only need to open the
          <code>GoReviewPartner.exe</code>
          file. I warn you, however, that, after several tests, I’ve had
          problems with some AIs: some of them were not changing the winning
          percentages by more than 1% throughout the whole analysis. I would
          suggest starting with the Leela and Leela Zero versions which use no
          GPU. If you still have questions and problems related to the GRP, its
          creator is available in the Life in 19×19 forum answering comments

            The GRP also analyzes other board sizes. (Although Leela Zero
            apparently rejects them.)

          It is possible to test a vast number of AIs with the various software
          mentioned. For example, we can try to replace the executable inside
          Lizzie with that of PhoenixGo, along with its weights, to have a new
          version of Lizzie. Nevertheless, I haven’t had much success with that
          technique and it seems the reason for the failure is, in fact, my
          hardware.

          On a sidenote, I would like to mention a smartphone app that runs
          Leela Zero. There are still some imperfections and bugs but it works
          well in general. The app is called

          and has both a free and a paid versions.

          Another update is a chinese app that featers AQ and Leela Zero in your
          phone,
