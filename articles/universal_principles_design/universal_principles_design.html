          This book is much better than a holy bible or some ten commandments of
          design: it goes beyond. It describes the what, answers the why,
          teaches the how and shows where it all came from.

          After watching Joe Natoli's

          is actually mostly based on solid science and research.

          I wish I had read this book years ago, when starting my engineering
          studies, it would have been much more worthwhile than blindly
          reproducing dummy silly mandatory projects on
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD">AutoCAD</a>. I think
          this book should be read by anyone, it would enable individuals to
          have a much more objective and productive way of criticizing our
          environment and society.

                <li>
                  Most designers, including Joe Natoli, say that this is
                  probably the most frequently broken principle in the real
                  world. After a bit more than 1 month producing and reviewing
                  designs, I would say I completely agree &mdash; just imagine
                  the mess if all of these bullet points and numbered principles
                  had the same indentation...
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is very impressive how much a design can improve by simply
                  aligning its items in a way that groups and similarities are
                  correctly in evidence. Doing the opposite can incur in
                  disastrous consequences, as was the case of the
                  <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida"
                    >Butterfly Ballot</a
                  >.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One very simple example of what not to do when it comes to
                  alignment is <em>long text with centered alignment</em>: the
                  left border alignment will be so irregular that the user will
                  have to put extra effort into keeping track of it. In sum,
                  only use centered text for one-liners or very short text.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              <strong>Biophilia Effect</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em
                    >Environments rich in nature views and imagery reduce stress
                    and enhance focus and concentration.</em
                  >
                </li>
                <li>
                  One interesting finding is that this effect does not seem to
                  require real plants in the environment, but mere imagery
                  &mdash; window views, posters on the wall, and so forth seem
                  to suffice.

                <li>
                  Some examples of beautiful application of this principle are:

                    >Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater</a

                    and cognition. High ceilings promote abstract thinking and

                    detail-oriented thinking.</em

                <li>
                  Different ceilings, different perspectives, it is not really
                  true that high ceilings are better:

                    <li>
                      High ceilings tend to improve focus on general product
                      characteristics and creativity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Low ceilings tend to improve focus on specific features
                      and problem solving.

              <strong>Cognitive Dissonance</strong>

                <li>
                  People alleviate cognitive dissonance in one of three ways: by
                  reducing the importance of dissonant cognitions, adding
                  consonant cognitions, or removing or changing dissonant
                  cognitions.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      For example, advertising campaigns that urge people to
                      show how much you care by buying diamonds seek to create
                      cognitive dissonance in consumers &mdash; i.e., dissonance
                      between the love that people have for others, and the
                      pressure to prove that love by buying diamonds. In order
                      to alleviate the dissonance, people can reduce the
                      importance of the dissonant cognition (e.g., a diamond is,
                      after all, just a bunch of pressed carbon), add consonant
                      cognitions (e.g., recognize that the advertising campaign
                      is trying to manipulate them using cognitive dissonance),
                      or remove or change dissonant cognitions (e.g., show how
                      much you care by doing something else or, of course,
                      buying the diamonds).
                    </li>

                  When a situation involves incentives, it is interesting to
                  note that incentives of different sizes yield different
                  results. Too big an incentive and the person will change her
                  behavior, but but diverge in her attitude<foot-note

                  Very closely related to <em>Cost-Benefit</em> is the principle
                  of <em>Affordance</em>.

                <li>
                  If the costs associated with interacting with a design
                  outweigh the benefits, the design is poor. If the benefits
                  outweigh the costs, the design is good. For example, walking
                  some distance to see a museum exhibit constitutes a cost. The
                  level of interest in the exhibit constitutes a benefit. Thus,
                  if the level of interest outweighs the cost of the walk, the
                  exhibit design is good.

                      In the end, the ultimate way of evaluating an app is with
                      a cost-benefit ratio. How many apps do you know which have
                      a higher cost of usability than their benefits?

                  This phenomenon is frequently experienced when learning new
                  vocabulary. Words that seem unfathomable are actually the ones
                  people tend to remember the most, due to their first attempts
                  at trying to initially understand what they meant.

                  Generally, specially among writers, it is believed that only
                  bad designs can come from committees. The compromises are so
                  inevitable and numerous that the end product is, supposedly,
                  invariably mediocre at best.

                  However, with large products, nothing would be done if
                  multiple inputs weren't accepted. If iterated correctly, these
                  inputs and proper management will lead to a superior product.

                      Autocracy is linear and fast, but risky and prone to
                      error. Democracy is iterative and slow, but careful and
                      resistant to error.

                  Desire lines generally refer to worn paths where people
                  naturally walk &mdash; the beaten path that trails off the
                  sidewalk, usually as a shortcut to a destination. But, more
                  generally, they are said to be an unbiased indication of how
                  an object or environment is actually used by people, which is
                  valuable information that can be applied to the design or, in
                  some cases, redesign of the object or environment.

                      Desire lines are being more and more incorporated into

                <li>
                  Images depicting a person with a high face-ism ratio &mdash;
                  the face takes up most of the image &mdash; focus attention on
                  the person’s intellectual and personality attributes. Images
                  depicting a person in a low face-ism ratio &mdash; the body
                  takes up most of the image &mdash; focus attention on the
                  physical and sensual attributes of the person. The face-ism
                  ratio is calculated by dividing the distance from the top of
                  the head to the bottom of the chin (head height) by the
                  distance from the top of the head to the lowest visible part
                  of the body (total visible height).

                      It is very common to see web pages being needlessly
                      sexualized by using images with high face-ism ratios,
                      when, in fact, it would have been more intellectually
                      compelling to use low face-ism ratios.

              <strong>Flexibility-Usability Tradeoff</strong>

                <li>
                  <em
                    >As the flexibility of a system increases, the usability of

                </li>
                <li>
                  The flexibility-usability tradeoff is related to the
                  well-known maxim, jack of all trades, master of none. Flexible
                  designs can perform more functions than specialized designs,
                  but they perform the functions less efficiently. Flexible
                  designs are, by definition, more complex than inflexible
                  designs, and as a result are generally more difficult to use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This is the cause of many web and mobile app failures.
                  Managers tend to overextend the focus of an app and the
                  quality of its usability sharply decreases.

              <strong>Form Follows Function</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>Beauty in design results from purity of function.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The form follows function corollary is interpreted in one of
                  two ways &mdash; as a description of beauty or a prescription
                  for beauty. The descriptive interpretation is that beauty
                  results from purity of function and the absence of
                  ornamentation. The prescriptive interpretation is that
                  aesthetic considerations in design should be secondary to
                  functional considerations. The corollary was adopted and
                  popularized by modernist architects in the early 20th century,
                  and has since been adopted by designers in a variety of
                  disciplines, causing many misinterpretations and design
                  disasters worldwide.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Both interpretations, when taken to the extreme, defeat any
                  design. Beauty without function has no usability. A functional
                  design without attractiveness will not make anyone want to use
                  it.

                  There are five levels of design:

                    <li>Functionality</li>

                  It's a very common mistake to strive for creativity directly,
                  where the perceived value is the highest. However, in doing
                  so, people forget to put sufficient effort into the 4 prior
                  levels.

                <li>
                  A good directive is to highlight at most 10% of the visible
                  design. High percentages can actually have a negative effect
                  on readability.

                  Bolding and italicizing are the most advisable ways of

                  Two other interesting principles closely related to

                  <em>Veblen Effect.</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Horror Vacui</em> means "fear of emptiness".</li>
                <li>
                  People tend to feel unease at emptiness. For example, an empty
                  sheet is a common source of anxiety; once the sheet starts to
                  get filled up, people will try to complete it with patterns
                  resembling the original ones.

                <li>
                  Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that the more
                  things exist within a design, the perceived value of each
                  particle decreases. That's one of the reasons for luxury
                  brands to display fewer items than their cheaper competitors.

                  The Ockham's razor is one of the most useful principles in
                  life. It is also closely related to the
                  <em>Pareto (80/20)</em> and the

                  for overenthusiastic engineers and designers to overengineer
                  products and systems.

                  Although the principle is named after William of Ockham, a
                  14th century Franciscan friar and logician, nobody has ever
                  truly confirmed its origins.

                      It is a very common mistake to only account for one
                      persona when, in fact, there might be 2 or more different
                      types of core customers for your service or product,
                      resulting in an oversimplifed product which accomodates no
                      one. Typically, products require around 3 primary personas
                      in order to achieve good quality.

                  Whenever stimuli are received by the senses &mdash; sights,
                  sounds, smells, touches, tastes &mdash; concepts are
                  automatically activated in memory. Once concepts are
                  activated, they stay activated for a period of time, capable
                  of influencing subsequent thoughts, reactions, emotions, and
                  behaviors.

                  In a classic experiment on the effects of priming, two groups
                  of college students were given a series of written language
                  tests. The language test for one group included words related
                  to politeness, and the language test for the other group
                  included words related to rudeness. Subjects were instructed
                  to complete the test, and then go down the hall and find the
                  test administrator to get instructions for their next task.
                  When each student completed his or her test and went down the
                  hall, the student found the test administrator engaged in a
                  conversation with another person. Unbeknownst to the students,
                  the real test regarded whether the students would interrupt
                  the conversation, or wait politely until the conversation
                  ended.
                  <em
                    >The results were dramatic: 63 percent of the students
                    primed with words related to rudeness interrupted, whereas
                    only 17 percent primed with words related to politeness
                    interrupted.</em

                  Recognition memory is attained through exposure, and does not
                  necessarily involve any memory about origin, context, or
                  relevance. It is simply memory that something (sight, sound,
                  smell, touch) has been experienced before. Recall memory is
                  attained through learning, usually involving some combination
                  of memorization, practice, and application. Recognition memory
                  is also retained for longer periods of time than recall
                  memory.

                  Upon my death, if anyone asked what principle was broken most
                  frequently during my lifetime, I'm certain I would answer that
                  the biggest human disease is the <em>Scaling Fallacy</em>.

                      Every manager I've ever encountered &mdash; including me,
                      of course &mdash;, from the lowest to the highest rank has
                      made this mistake in his or her past: no, things
                      <em>almost always</em> do <em>not</em> scale linearly; no,
                      your product that works in a small scale will probably
                      <em>not</em> work in the same way in a bigger scale.
                    </li>

                <li>
                  There are <em>two</em> basic kinds of scaling assumptions to
                  avoid when growing or shrinking a design:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Load assumptions occur when designers scale a design by
                      some factor, and assume that the working stresses on the
                      design scale by that same factor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Interaction assumptions occur when designers scale a
                      design, and assume that the way people and other systems
                      interact with the design will be the same at other levels
                      of scale.

                    A phenomenon of memory in which items presented at the

                  The <em>von Restorff Effect</em> is another very interesting
                  effect related to memory retention.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are two major types of serial position effects:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Primacy effects occur because the initial items in a list
                      are stored in long-term memory more efficiently than items
                      later in the list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Recency effects occur because the last few items in a list
                      are still in working memory, and readily available.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Serial Position Effect should be taught to anyone who's
                  going to make a prsentation. The order in which the content is
                  presented is going to completely alter how it will be
                  memorized and, more importantly, interpreted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For visual stimuli, items presented early in a list have the
                  greatest influence; they are not only better recalled, but
                  influence the interpretation of later items. For auditory
                  stimuli, items late in a list have the greatest influence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Present important items at the beginning or end of a list
                  (versus the middle) in order to maximize recall. When the list
                  is visual, present important items at the beginning of the
                  list. When the list is auditory, present important items at
                  the end. In decision-making situations, if the decision is to
                  be made immediately after the presentation of the last item,
                  increase the probability of an item being selected by
                  presenting it at the end of the list; otherwise, present it at
                  the beginning of the list.
