      <h1>Negative Language: WHY you should avoid it</h1>

      <p>
        Until recently, I had not given that much attention to one habit we
        humans have: negative language<foot-note
          text='Negative Language is simply negating an assertion, e.g., 
          "don&apos;t do this", "stop doing that", etc.'
        ></foot-note
        >. This is done primarily by those who teach &mdash; not necessarily
        teachers, they could be bosses for example, which is probably the most
        common case nowadays. The issue with this kind of language is that it is
        mostly incredibly vague: it tells us what not to do in the hopes that,
        with such a marvelous hint, the student will be able to narrow down the
        entire universe of possible actions to the only ones that are in fact
        correct. Needless to say that the master’s hopes are naïve at best.

        My reasoning can be more clearly understood with the help of the Venn
        Diagram<foot-note
          text="Don’t worry, it’s just a fancy math name for drawing sets of things."
        ></foot-note>

          The problem with Negative Language: not being specific about what you
          should do.

        The grey area is everything you could do, and the yellow one, what
        should be done. Unfortunately, frequently, we will end up in places such
        as the red dot, where our teacher/boss will happily reprimend us and
        think that enough information has been provided . Surely it helps to say
        we were wrong, it’s better than nothing, but it’s unexpectedly devoid of
        much content. In the end, we are left with the negation of the red dot
        as the possibly correct actions<foot-note
          text="In math’s terms: 
          &lt;em&gt;Updated Possible Actions Universe = U – Red Dot&lt;/em&gt;"
        ></foot-note
        >, resulting in a lot of other painful attempts until we reach the
        yellow circle. This type of language is, coincidentally, what most Asian
        masters in movies use<foot-note
          text="And no: that’s not what happens in real life most of the time, 
          believe me, I’ve actually been to Asia."
        ></foot-note
        >, and exactly that which is very often repudiated by most experts as
        being a terrible waste of time and expertise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Negative Language is also not welcome in many other topics, such as
        Nonviolent Communication<foot-note
          text='In the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Changing-Relationships/dp/189200528X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=30TYGVO1F0KRM&keywords=nonviolent+communication+by+marshall+rosenberg&qid=1560033436&s=gateway&sprefix=nonviolen%2Caps%2C261&sr=8-1"&gt;book by the same name&lt;/a&gt;, 
          by Marshall B. Rosenberg, for example.'
        ></foot-note
        >, as the type of language that stifles the brain. And the reason is
        basically self-evident after what was discussed: we end up with too big
        an area to look for answers and, thus, we are simply overwhelmed by the
        amount of possible actions in the search space.

        Eventually, it all boils down to something I’ve learned through Go
        &mdash; and martial arts &mdash;: a punch to the face will (almost)
        always beat (fluffy) indirect movements; i.e., use direct and positive
        assertions, not indirect information or circumventions.
