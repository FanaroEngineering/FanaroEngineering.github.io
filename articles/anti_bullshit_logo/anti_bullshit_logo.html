      <h1>My First Logo and Its Formula</h1>

      <p>
        Strictly speaking, this isn't really 100% my invention. I've got 90% of
        the inspiration from the Anti Hentai Hentai Club T-Shirt. I still don't
        know the true origin of the logo, but, from watching
        <a href="https://twitter.com/rickyftw">Ricky</a> and
        <a
          href="https://twitter.com/EliotETC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"

          The original Anti Hentai Hentai Club T-Shirt, worn by
          <a href="https://twitter.com/rickyftw">Ricky</a>, from the YouTube
          channel
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyZVCV9xhrCyz4hPehvb4Wg"
            >Internet Today</a

      <p>
        You can make your own version of this T-Shirt too, you will only need to
        replace the "bullshit" or "hentai" for something that is bad, but, when
        taken jokingly, lightly or unseriously, is at least marginally positive.
        In the end, this logo is probably one of the most elementary templates
        for an <em>oxymoron</em>, so you can look for books or articles on this
        type of figure of speech if you want to conceive a better, literary
        version of the logo.
      </p>
      <p>
        \[ Oxymoronic \ Logo = \textbf{ANTI} \ \texttt{&lt;concept&gt;} \
        \texttt{&lt;concept&gt;} \ \textbf{CLUB} \]
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to the font, I'm not 100% sure what the original is. Using
        Adobe Capture's Type functionality, the closest I could get was
        <em>Alverata Informal Black</em
        ><foot-note
          text='The "U" doesn&apos;t match, but the rest is very close.'
        ></foot-note
        >. The original designers also seem to have deconstructed the fonts in
        order to bend and warp the letters, which I consciously chose to not do.

        I'm sharing my Adobe Illustrator file
        <local-link
          link="anti_bullshit_bullshit_club.zip"
          text="here"
        ></local-link
        ><foot-note
          text="I'm not a very experienced designer, so don't expect too much."
        ></foot-note>
        so you may stamp your own T-Shirt if you wish to &mdash; just give me a
        shoutout on Twitter for recognition if you like the design. I chose the
        <em>Philosopher</em
        ><foot-note
          text="A fitting font name for this select club, isn't it?"
        ></foot-note
        ><em> Bold</em> font for the end design; you can use Adobe's Creative
        Cloud to download it, or, alternatively, you can use the deconstructed
        version I left in the left-most, final canvas inside the
        <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier">.ai</span> file.

          The front side had the logo too close to the left armpit
          unfortunately.

        <figcaption>
          The back side looks ok, maybe moving it up a bit would be better
          though.
