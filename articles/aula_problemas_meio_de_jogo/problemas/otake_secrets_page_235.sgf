The two were lifelong rivals.

This game was played approximately 350 years ago, and it is remarkable that this quality of play could have arisen in such an age.

Black has just played the marked stone.

I suppose that everyone would answer with white **A**. However, here Dosaku came out with an amazing strategy. Somehow he ended up sacrificing five white stones that he had just played.

That is wonderful decisiveness. This is a daring large scale sacrifice stone strategy. After this, he wrested away the initiative and ushered in the win.

This is truly nothing less than remarkable.

Please read the text and see how Dosaku Sensei played to accomplish that.

This is reminiscent of the *tewari* move order analysis that Dosaku previously introduced.

---

This game was played when Dosaku was 23 years old and Chitetsu was 24.

The games that Dosaku played in his youth were played before he attained greatness.

Chitetsu was his lifelong rival and in their careers they played 48 games against each other.

The games of Dosaku that have come down to us number 153.

Within that collection, approximately one third of the games were played with Chitetsu.

Anyway, Dosaku towered above other players of that era.]AB[qd][pe][nd][lc][ce][ch][eq][ip][io][kq][lp][ko][mp][np][op][oq][or][rq][ro][qo][po][lm][rm][qm][om][pm][ol][ok][ql][oi][pi][nh]AW[oc][cc][ec][cp][hp][iq][jq][nr][os][pr][pq][pp][rp][sq][rr][oo][on][mo][nm][ll][ml][km][jn][pl][pk][qk][rk][rl][qh][oh][og]AE[kc][rn][nl]TR[pi]LB[qh:A];B[](;W[nj]TE[1](;B[oj]C[Black's response make White's 5 stones light.
