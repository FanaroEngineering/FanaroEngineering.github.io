However, White 4 sets up a splitting attack against Black's groups on both sides. This result is greatly inferior to the tesuji combination in the correct answer.])(;B[fg]BM[1];W[df];B[gi]LB[df:A]C[After looking at this sequence, it will be evident that `A` is a key move for White. Interchangeably, it is probably a key move for Black as well.]))
