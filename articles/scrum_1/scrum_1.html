        Scrum, by Jeff Sutherland : The Book EVERYONE Should Read (Part 1)
      </h1>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <strong
        >If there is one book I would like to give to my past self, this is
        it</strong
      >. Don't miss it.
      <p>
        <strong
          >Most people think this book &mdash;
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JI54HCU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o04?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"
            >Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time</a
          >
          &mdash; is specific to software development. However</strong
        >, that's a
        <em><strong>very unfortunate misconception</strong>.</em> Scrum is about
        being productive, it mostly doesn't matter the task. It's actually an
        algorithm of <strong>iterative planning </strong>&mdash; i.e., instead
        of making long-term plans, we adjust the course periodically &mdash;,
        encompassing not really only teams but also individuals &mdash; in fact,
        I've been using it for a while to organize myself and it works
        wonderfully.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Scrum, by Jeff Sutherland, is also incredible even if you're very
        experienced with Scrum. It discusses <strong><em>why</em></strong> Scrum
        is like it is.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If you need real world examples of successful projects that used Scrum,
        there is no shortage: from complex software to hardware, cars, changing
        the whole structure of FBI investigations, managing news teams,
        improving (revolutionizing) traditional classrooms, changing how
        governmental projects are developed, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post(s) &mdash; this will probably be a series of posts actually
        &mdash;, I'll be <strong>spoiling</strong> the book completely: I'll
        summarize the major concepts and solutions Jeff Sutherland, the
        (co-)creator of Scrum, exposes in it. But that
        <strong
          ><em>should not</em> deter you from reading the book actually</strong
        >, the stories he tells us are amazing by themselves, and they do
        reinforce the arguments he wants to prove by a lot. As he mentions in
        the book: <strong>the stories provide the <em>why</em></strong> of the
        methods,
        <strong>while the methods themselves are extremely simple</strong> and
        can be learned in
        <a href="https://youtu.be/XU0llRltyFM">10-minute videos on Youtube</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in practicing Scrum right away,
        <strong>besides the traditional physical board and sticky notes</strong
        >, you could use some quite neat <strong>software solutions</strong>.
        The one I would really recommend is from Atlassian: the famous
        <a href="https://trello.com/en-US">Trello</a>. Another option, if you're
        building software, is to use the
        <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/product/issueboard/"
          >Issue Boards from Gitlab</a
        >
        or the
        <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards"
          >Projects Boards from Github</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would also like to remark that
        <strong>Scrum is not another management fad</strong> to make directors
        and managers look cool. In fact,
        <strong>Scrum is a way of getting bullshit out of the way</strong>. As
        an iterative method, if the team thinks that the introduced
        "improvement" is not helping at all, they discard it in the next
        iteration: and that's the quick end of the dreaded fad. Scrum is also
        partially based on the Toyota Production System (Lean Production
        Systems), a more than half-century old system idolized by top executives
        around the globe, and which, curiously, is in turn based on US
        industrial best practices from the early 20th century. And, if that
        isn't enough to convince you of its value, one of its founders,
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffsutherland/">Jeff Sutherland</a
        >, is a Korean War Veteran Pilot, a West Point Engineer, a Stanford
        Statistician and a PhD in Biometrics by the University of Colorado of
        Medicine<foot-note
          text='You can also watch a
        &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/s4thQcgLCqk"&gt;TED Talk&lt;/a&gt; from Jeff if you&apos;re
        curious.'
        ></foot-note
        >. So, in short, Scrum is
        <strong>based on empirical and scientific methods</strong>,
        <em>there will not be any esoteric bullshit.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Before continuing on to the bulk of this post, I would like to reiterate
        that the biggest value of the book is within its stories. It is through
        them that we humans (perhaps unfortunately) really learn. Make no
        mistake, though, by assuming that this book is not serious.

      <h1>1. The Way the World Works is Broken</h1>
      <p>
        As the name indicates, this chapter is about
        <strong>convincing the reader that a change is necessary</strong>
        &mdash; the second one also serves this purpose. And, boy, is it
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in the 1990's, when Jeff Sutherland was first transitioning from
        his academic career, people were overwhelmingly using the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model"
          >Waterfall Method</a
        >
        to design software. This method was invented in the 1950's and would
        prescribe directives to planning software projects:
        <strong>static directives</strong>. Managers and directors would
        carefully lay out almost immutable planning that should be carried out
        for months and years without knowing what their customer
        <em>really</em> wanted or what would happen in the meantime. Eventually,
        the Waterfall Syndrome would be characterized by giant
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">Gantt charts</a>
        &mdash; a sort of sequence diagram from the 1910's &mdash; displaying
        <strong><em>documentation for the sake of documentation</em></strong
        >, a product that was different from what the customer expected or
        wanted, and a titanic hole in the company's budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The genre of static planning is not dumb intrinsically though</em>.
        It appeared in an era where, probably due to no feedback to the product
        developers, engineers would have to use their intuition to guess what
        the customer wanted. However, it becomes evident that, once feedback
        exists, static planning is only a very small set of iterative planning,
        or, in other words, <em>simply inferior</em>. And that inferiority
        became blindingly clear in one of the biggest flops of the Waterfall
        series of disasters: updating the FBI Database System.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was 2010 and the FBI still used physical documents to proceed with
        investigations. <em>Physical documents with 3 copies </em> &mdash;
        <em>!!!</em>. Any procedure would first have to be approved by some
        mysterious boss up the hierarchical chain with a mystical red pen in
        order to get things started. Those were not the 1950's, they were the
        2010's.
      </p>
      <p>
        When
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">9/11</a>
        happened, the biggest criticism of the entities externally auditing the
        FBI was the sluggish communications inside the institution, making
        things painfully slow and easily exploitable by terrorists. Following
        severe Senate scrutiny, the FBI was virtually forced to modernize its
        system: an initial bill of US$ 170 million. Three years later and
        nothing had been accomplished. <em>Nothing</em>.
        <strong
          >People were <em>literally</em> dying because of planning for the sake
          of planning</strong
        >, beautiful Gantt charts everywhere and no product, no update anywhere
        to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        But don't worry, let's try again. This time we are going to privatize
        the renewing process, that will surely solve the problem. Let's take a
        great, big company like <em>Lockheed Martin </em>and everything should
        be fine. It was 2010 and Lockheed had spent US$ 405 million with
        <em>only half of the specifications</em>, estimating another 8 years of
        work and an extra US$ 350 million to get the software completely done. A
        database update was turning out to become an almost billion dollar,
        decades lost, gigantic flop: the way the world works is broken.
      </p>

      <h3>1.1 Planning is Useful, Blindly Following Plans is Stupid</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless,
          but planning is indispensable.
        </p>
        <p class="quote-author">Dwight D. Eisenhower</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The FBI case illustrates the main recurrent theme of the book and the
        <strong>cause for Scrum's creation</strong>:
        <strong>human misinterpretation</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever we plan, we are creating an interpretation of the world that
        may be either not true or only true for a brief period of time. We must
        take that into account. The problem is that Waterfall methods or Gantt
        charts create plans that are not meant to change, they do not
        incorporate change in their logic. Through iterative methods such as
        Scrum, we adjust our interpretations with periodic tests, trying to
        steadily reach the customer's mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you still question Scrum's value, take the extensive research made by
        (dead serious) companies such as Gartner, Forrester Research and the
        Standish Group: "companies that still cling to tried but-not-true ideas
        of command and control and that attempt to impose rigid predictability
        are simply doomed to fail if their competitors use Scrum". Companies,
        thus, have two choices: change or die<foot-note
          text="I would rephrase it into
        &lt;em&gt;Evolve or Die&lt;/em&gt;, after all, change could mean something that's
        only different and not necessarily better, which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the
        case."
        ></foot-note
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of the aforementioned FBI database update, after using
        Scrum, with 5% of Lockheed's budget, less than 25% of the employees, and
        less than a 18 months (25% of Lockheed's estimate), the FBI in-house
        developers delivered a functional product with 90% of the original
        specifications. If that's not a slap to the face of traditional methods,
        nothing will be.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Empirical Basis</h3>
      <p>
        One of the other reasons for the downfall of traditional planning is
        related to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Rule</a
        >. It states that, in most endeavors,
        <strong
          >20% of the invested time or effort accomplishes 80% of the final
          value</strong
        >. However, to really nail that 20% gold nugget, you have to really know
        where the value lies, which is something you will almost never do at the
        first iterations. If you're spending 5 years to get <em>only </em>50% of
        value, like Lockheed Martin did, you have to become aware that you're
        doing something wrong.
      </p>
      The Pareto Rule and other practical, empirical methods led software
      development leaders, in 2001, to write what would be later known as the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"
        ><em>Agile Manifesto</em></a
      >
      &mdash; guidelines that can only be appreciated after you've felt the pain
      of dealing with traditional planning &mdash;, leading a wave of new, more
      pragmatic management methods:
      <ol>
        <li>People over Processes;</li>
        <li>
          Products that actually work over documenting what that product is
          supposed to do;
        </li>
        <li>Collaborating with customers over negotiating with them;</li>
        <li>Responding to change over following a plan.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Another empirical basis for Scrum's methods is the
        <strong>Toyota Production System</strong> (TPS), especially
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiichi_Ohno"
          >Taiichi Ohno's <em>8 Wastes</em></a
        >. Essentially, TPS is flipping traditional management upside down.
        <strong
          >Instead of having managers carefully correcting and micromanaging
          their workers</strong
        >
        all day everyday,
        <strong>managers will actually be <em>master-servants</em></strong
        >, whose only function is to get things out of the way of their teams,
        i.e., <strong>eliminate impediments</strong>. An example of this occurs
        at the end of every production cycle or <em>sprint</em>:
        <strong
          >the manager will always ask the team what can be done to improve
          <em>how </em>they work</strong
        >, what impediments should be eliminated. By constantly improving
        <em>how</em> they work, for example, the in-house FBI team initially
        increased their productivity by a factor of 3 &mdash; and that's not
        really that impressive, great teams can sometimes get up to an 8 times
        increase. In later chapters, we will delve into a more in-depth
        discussion about the correlation between TPS and Scrum, dating back to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming"
          >W. Edwards Deming</a
        >
        and the revolution the American engineer and statistician caused in the
        Japanese industry, which later <em>rerevolutionized</em> the world's
        software industry.
      </p>

      <h1>2. The Origins of Scrum</h1>
      <p>
        It is not possible to dissociate Scrum's origins from Jeff Sutherland's
        formation. And, at the core of it is his career as a
        <em>Korean War Pilot</em>. There, he learned one of the most important
        methods of his life: the
        <em>OODA Loop, Observe, Orient, Decide and Act.</em>
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="ooda.png" alt="OODA Loop" />
        <figcaption>
          The OODA Loop, created by John "Mad Major" Boyd.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The OODA Loop served as an inspiration to the
        <em>iterative nature</em> of Scrum. It was invented by the legendary
        <em>Mad Major, </em>John Boyd, as a way of understanding
        <em>why </em>American pilots were overwhelming Russian bigger, faster,
        stronger fighter jets.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, after long research, Boyd found that the most important part
        was guaranteeing constant feedback to the pilot, which would make him
        able to change his orientations, decisions and actions constantly and
        accordingly. The feedbacks inside the OODA loops would make quite the
        mark on Jeff, being essential to the later development of Scrum.
      </p>
      <p>
        After his career in the military, and having obtained a bachelor's
        degree in engineering, and earning a master's degree in statistics,
        Sutherland spent years in a PhD program, and as a researcher in the
        University of Colorado trying to understand what happens in a cell to
        turn it cancerous. Years later, when a sudden change in politics would
        drastically diminish investments at his institution<foot-note
          text="Reagonomics..."
        ></foot-note
        >, he realized that he could perhaps apply what he had learned about
        complex systems to organizations and teams in the corporate world: "how
        can we figure out simple rules that will guide teams to settle into a
        more productive, happier, supportive, fun, and ecstatic state?"
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1983, <em>MidContinent Computer Services</em> contacted him about
        their hottest new product: the <em>Automatic Teller</em>
        <em>Machine, </em>later known as the <em>ATM</em
        ><foot-note
          text="You can thank him someday for that product if you cross him on the streets."
        ></foot-note
        >. As was expected at the time, development was carried out using the
        dreaded Waterfall method, leading to much more than a budget disaster
        &mdash; costs were 30% higher than revenue. Screaming, micromanaging,
        passive-aggressive behavior and demands for harder work and overtime
        were common practice. Change or die: "the first thing we need to do is
        to stop doing stuff that is killing us (...) we've got to figure out a
        better way of working", Jeff told his superior.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ATM project would be the practical birthground of Scrum. Ten years
        later and the best practices developed in that project would be refined
        into the concepts of the
        <em>Product Owner, the Product Backlog, Sprints,</em> etc.
      </p>

      <h3>2.1 Learning to Think Like a Robot</h3>
      <p>
        A little bit later in his corporate career, Sutherland happened to share
        the building with some MIT robotics professors and PhD students. MIT
        didn't have enough space for all of their mechatronics researchers so
        they outsourced the space. It just so happens that from time to time
        some of their robots would go into Sutherland's office and chase him
        non-stop. Fascinated about those machines, he would later ask Professor
        Rodney Brooks about <em>how they worked</em>. Prof. Brooks's answer
        would spark some of the key ideas behind the essence of Scrum.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, scientists spent billions of dollars and many, many years of
        hard work trying to build and code the
        <strong>biggest computers and databases</strong>. But, at the
        end,<strong>
          all they got was a computer that could beat humans in chess</strong
        >. There <strong>needed to be another approach</strong> to building
        these supermachines. So his team started to experiment with a whole new
        paradigm. The idea was, instead of building a brain that would control
        everything, to build modular parts that could think for themselves and,
        most importantly, interact with the other parts. The key was to make
        <strong>each module's main concern simply </strong
        ><strong>not to impede the other ones</strong><em>. </em>And that's how
        Scrum converged with the Toyota Production System in a way that was both
        empirical and logical. Another key takeaway from the robot's behavior
        was it being completely <strong>autonomous</strong>; there was no master
        server or hardcoded recipe: it learned to interact with the outside
        world from scratch and it optimized for its own modules' behaviors.
      </p>
      As it happens, Prof. Brooks later became world-famous for one of his
      little cleaning robots: the
      <a href="https://www.irobot.com/roomba">iRobot's Roomba</a>.
      <h3>2.2 Looking for Something Better than Waterfalls</h3>
      <p>
        After his departure from his job near MIT in 1993, Sutherland became the
        VP of Object Technology &mdash; whatever that means &mdash; at Easel.
        The executives at Easel wanted him to develop a completely new product
        in 6 months for one of their biggest customers: Ford. After a little bit
        of experience within the company he sat down with his team and told them
        the bitter truth:
        <em
          >they wouldn't be delivering anything if they stuck to Gantt charts
          and Waterfall bullshit</em
        >. His later <strong>dialogue trying to convince the CEO</strong> is
        quite remarkable:
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        “How many Gantt charts have you seen in your career?”, I asked.
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">“Hundreds,” he replied.</p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">“How many of them were right?”</p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">He paused. “None.”</p>
      <p>
        His team spent a few weeks researching about new, better management
        methods and eventually stumbled upon the most crucial seed of Scrum:
        <a href="https://www.scruminc.com/scrum-godfathers-takeuchi-and-nonaka/"
          ><em>The New New Product Development Game</em></a
        >, by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka, published on the
        <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, in 1986. Directly from Jeff's book
        &mdash; bold characters are <em>my</em> editing:
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        Takeuchi and Nonaka had looked at teams from some of the world’s most
        productive and innovative companies: Honda, Fuji-Xerox, 3M,
        Hewlett-Packard, and others. They argued that the old way of doing
        product development,
        <em>typified by NASA’s Phased Program Planning system</em
        ><foot-note
          text="In the
        article, it is mentioned that the Japanese tried to implement NASA's
        planning methods in their plants. However, it was a huge disaster.
        Mistakes and deliveries were rampant and they went back to their usual
        planning methods. Guess what was the reason for it..."
        ></foot-note>
        &mdash; a Waterfall system &mdash; was fundamentally flawed. Instead,
        the best companies used an overlapping development process that was
        faster and more flexible. The <strong>teams</strong> were
        <strong>cross-functional</strong>. The teams had
        <strong>autonomy</strong>. They were empowered to make their own
        decisions. And they had a <strong>transcendent purpose</strong>. They
        were reaching for something bigger than themselves.
        <strong>Management didn’t dictate</strong>. Instead,
        <strong>executives were servant-leaders</strong> and facilitators
        focused on
        <strong>getting obstacles out of their teams’ way</strong> rather than
        telling them what and how to do product development. The Japanese
        professors compared the teams’ work to that of a rugby team and said the
        best teams acted as though they were in a <strong>scrum</strong>: “(...)
        the ball gets passed within the team as it moves as a unit up the
        field.”
      </p>
      <p>
        At Easel, they had nothing to lose when compared to the mediocrity of
        Waterfall-type of methods. After six months, and after having spent
        almost one innovating about <em>how to work</em>, they had managed to
        successfully deliver the product. Less than two years later, in 1995,
        Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber would publish the paper
        <em>SCRUM Development Process</em>, at the Association for Computing
        Machinery Research Conference, giving formal birth to the method.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a "minor" anecdote to end this (sub)section, I would like to mention
        a story told later in the book about a joint venture between General
        Motors and Toyota.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1982, GM closed the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. (NUMMI) plant
        in Freemont, California:
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        Management considered the workforce the worst in America. People drank
        on the job, didn’t show up for work, and subtly sabotaged the cars (by,
        for example, putting a Coke bottle inside a door, where it would rattle
        and annoy customers). Toyota reopened the plant in 1984.
        <strong
          >GM told them about how awful the workers were but that the managers
          were great</strong
        >
        and they should rehire them. Instead,
        <strong
          >Toyota declined to rehire the managers and rehired most of the
          original workforce</strong
        >
        &mdash; even sent some of them to Japan to learn the Toyota Production
        System.
        <strong
          >Almost immediately the NUMMI plant was producing cars with the same
          precision and as few defects as cars that were produced in
          Japan</strong
        >. Same people, different system. GM never reached those levels of
        quality at any of its other American plants. It pulled out of the joint
        operating agreement the same year it went bankrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
        This comes from a discussion farther in the book. Summarizing, the moral
        of the story is that people are usually not the problem,<strong>
          the system is the biggest source of issues in fact</strong
        >
        &mdash; "look for flawed systems, not flawed workers".
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Inspect and Adapt</h3>
      <p>
        As previously stated, Scrum teams commonly achieve
        <em>hyperproductivity</em>. This can go from 300-400%, to 800% on very
        good teams. In order to reach for these impressive numbers you have to
        guarantee that your team has:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Autonomy</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cross-functionality</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Transcendent Purpose</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But how do you <em>actually </em>achieve that? Well, I &mdash; and Jeff
        as well &mdash; won't be explaining that so briefly here. That's
        basically the next 200 pages of the book. However, we can at least (very
        briefly) discuss the seeds of the thinking process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scrum comes from techniques used in Japanese manufacturing, but where
        those come from might surprise you:
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        Ironically, they learned many from an American:
        <strong>W. Edwards Deming</strong>. Deming worked for General Douglas
        MacArthur during the American occupation of Japan after World War II.
        MacArthur’s approach to rebuilding the economy was to fire most of the
        senior management in Japanese companies, promote line managers from the
        ranks, and bring in business operations experts like Deming from the
        United States. Deming’s influence on Japanese manufacturing was
        dramatic. He trained hundreds of engineers in what is called “<strong
          >statistical process control</strong
        >.” The basic idea is to measure exactly what is being done, and how
        well, and to strive for “<strong>continuous improvement.</strong>”
        <strong>Don’t just get better once; get better constantly</strong>.
        Always be looking for something to improve. Never, ever settle for where
        you are. How you get there is to be constantly creating experiments to
        see if you can achieve improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deming created, in parallel, a similar reinforcing loop to John Boyd's
        OODA loops called the <strong>PDCA Cycle</strong> (Plan, Do, Check, Act)
        which was and still is taught in management courses around the globe.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Change or Die</h3>
      <p>
        Again, I would rather say "Evolve or Die",
        <strong
          >Scrum is better than rudimentary management techniques, it is not
          <em>only</em> different</strong
        >. To illustrate that it <em>is </em>really better
        <strong
          >no matter the circumstances, no matter how good the team is</strong
        >, Sutherland mentions a consulting experience he had at a company
        called <em>BellSouth</em>:
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        I learned this firsthand at BellSouth, when I visited them as a
        consultant years ago. They had top-notch engineers, many from the famous
        Bell Labs. They executed Waterfall perfectly. They’d bid on huge $ 10-
        to $ 20-million projects. They’d gather all the requirements from the
        customer, then go away for eighteen months and deliver on time and on
        budget exactly what the customer had asked for. They were one of the
        very, very few companies in the entire world that could pull that off.
        <strong
          >The problem was, at that point the customer no longer wanted what
          they’d said they wanted</strong
        >.
        <strong
          ><em
            >Circumstances had changed. Business cycles were getting shorter,
            and customers were demanding more responsive services.</em
          ></strong
        >
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        I was brought in to see if I could help BellSouth figure out what they
        were doing wrong. I soon realized it was the entire way they were
        working. This can be tough to hear when it seems as if you’re doing
        everything right. So one day I stood before a roomful of 150 BellSouth
        engineers and told them that unless they changed to a different, more
        customer-responsive model, they wouldn’t last as a going concern. The
        crowd was tough. They were all really smart men and women, but they
        believed my ideas were just another management fad. I couldn’t get
        through to them, so I just shrugged and left them with a final warning:
        “<strong>Change or die</strong>.”
        <em>As you may have noticed, BellSouth isn’t around anymore.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What happened is a reflex of the shocking efficiency numbers he
        mentioned before. If your competition is using Scrum to achieve 300-800%
        higher efficiency than traditional methods, how beyond mind-boggling
        spectacular does your team have to be to compensate for that? You just
        won't find many people like that. And, if you do, you might as well use
        iterative methods like Scrum.
      </p>

      <h3>2.5 <em>Shu Ha Ri</em></h3>
      <p>
        This is something I've experienced quite a lot in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go (Baduk or Weiqi)</a
        >. It is present in almost all Asian martial arts also, not only
        <em>Aikido</em>, which is the example Sutherland uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I think that Aikido's teaching methods are incredibly
        inefficient and the major reason for its unpopular status, not really
        because it's a bit esoteric and too specific. In this martial art,
        <strong
          >the master will not <em>teach</em> the technique; at most, he will
          <em>show</em> you how it's done</strong
        >. The purpose of this is to show the student that
        <strong
          >learning by doing is the only way to <em>real</em> mastery</strong
        >. The problem here is that, if the master taught the student about the
        student's specific weaknesses, the pupil might need to practice less on
        unnecessary content, being able to focus on more interesting or valuable
        concepts and, perhaps, even innovating on some. In sum, there's a huge
        waste of expertise in this sport,
        <em
          >it feels as if the master were hiding precious knowledge only due to
          blind tradition and pride.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, the three <em>Shu Ha Ri</em> states can be found in all crafts,
        not only martial arts. In my only visit to China, in 2017, in Hangzhou,
        I received as a gift from some Monks a fan that had a similar
        inscription on it. I don't quite recall what the ideograms really meant,
        but it was something like: "first, you see; then you don't; and,
        finally, you don't need to". Sounds really mysterious, huh? It is
        supposed to mean that, first <em>(<strong>Shu</strong>),</em> you think
        that you know what you're doing, you will follow the master and think
        that's all there is to it, you're apparently on the direct and correct
        track. Then (<em><strong>Ha</strong>)</em> you start to grasp a little
        bit of the overarching concepts behind what you were first learning and
        realize that it was all just the tip of the iceberg: you can't see
        anymore, it is all overwhelming. Finally (<strong><em>Ri</em></strong
        >), you incorporate the essence of whatever it is that you're learning,
        to the point where <em>you are the living manifestation of it</em>, you
        don't need to see it, <em>you simply are it.</em> From my experience in
        Go and other crafts, the tougher the art you're trying to learn, the
        more cyclical <em>Shu Ha Ri </em>becomes, i.e., the more times you will
        sequentially loop through the three states.
      </p>
      In the book, <em>Shu Ha Ri </em>is formulated as:
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        [In the]<em><strong> Shu</strong></em> state you know all the rules and
        the forms. You repeat them, like the steps in a dance, so your body
        absorbs them. You don’t deviate at all.
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        In the <em><strong>Ha</strong></em> state, once you’ve mastered the
        forms, you can make innovations. Put an extra swing in your step down
        the dance floor.
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        In the <em><strong>Ri</strong></em> state you’re able to discard the
        forms, you’ve truly mastered the practice, and you’re able to be
        creative in an unhindered way, because the knowledge of the meaning of
        aikido or the tango is so deeply embedded in you, your every step
        expresses its essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lesson Sutherland tries to convey with the discussion about
        <em>Shu Ha Ri </em>is that, although learning the Scrum's "rules" and
        "recipes" is quick and easy. It will take you a lot of time and, most
        importantly, <strong>practice</strong> to reach its
        <em>Ri, mastery </em>state.
