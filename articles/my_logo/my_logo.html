      <h1>How I created my logo</h1>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="The Idea"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          The idea behind my logo came to me after struggling with the
          infinitely fragmented knowledge we typically have in schools and
          universities. Centralization and connections within each person's
          knowledge base has since become one of my most important missions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not surprisingly, some people also do get it, and have come to the
          same conclusion, though through very different paths. For example, Dr.
          Alan Watkins<foot-note
            text="If you haven't, go watch his 
            &lt;a href='https://youtu.be/q06YIWCR2Js'&gt;amazing lecture&lt;/a&gt; 
            on how to better perform under pressure."
          ></foot-note
          >, in his book
          <a
            href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18210521-coherence?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=yVDHHh3LV8&rank=2"
            ><em>Coherence</em></a
          >, argues that the challenge of this century will lie on reintegrating
          all of our overspecialized, island fields: we will, as some science
          fiction has already stated, end up
          <em>knowing everything about nothing</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The marketplace seems to be at the culprit, the more specialized you
          are, the more sought after you will be, generic problems can be solved
          by most, after all. However, this can backfire when the complexity of
          the managed system starts to spread along different subjects. That
          might be one of the major causes of why there's usually a critical
          mass or size for many companies, which crumble under their own
          complexity weight, giving rise to usually new and lean competitors.
          The cycle of corporate life repeats, and humans, who have a hard time
          learning from their ancestors' mistakes, will have an even harder time
          learning from their corporate ancestors' mistakes.
        </p>

        <p>
          This capitalist problem creeps into universities and schools as well,
          but maybe in a different shape. The more isolated departments are from
          each other the easier it is to justify their own existence and
          budgets, the easier it is to make it hard for others to get anything
          done in your topic.

        <custom-h2 text="The Math Supporting The Design"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          It's easy to spot why people find it hard and cumbersome to keep
          everything connected. By laying it out in a graph<foot-note
            text="Just a fancy word for a drawing with nodes and connections."
          ></foot-note
          >, we can see that different topics, with typical sequential
          connections, form a polygon. Connecting all of the vertices of a
          polygon seems to grow very quickly as we grow the number of sides.
        </p>

        <!-- TODO: sample graph image -->

        <p>
          That's because they grow quadratically &mdash; \(O(n^2)\) &mdash;, not
          linearly &mdash; \(O(n)\) &mdash;. The number of connections,
          specially the inner ones, as we shall see, grow with the square of the
          number of sides, which is jargon for "boy, do they grow fast". But how
          quickly do they grow, you might ask?
        </p>

        <p>
          It turns out that connecting dots is analogous to making
          <em>combinations</em> of pairs, at least in this case. That means
          order doesn't matter either, so we can use the usual
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"
            >combinatorics formula</a
          ><foot-note
            text="This is coincidentally 
            &lt;a href='https://fanaro.io/articles/scrum_2/scrum_2.html#3-communication-channels-inside-teams-(p-59)'&gt;the same formula used to justify the optimal 
            size of programming teams in Scrum&lt;/a&gt;."
          ></foot-note>
          we learn in high school:
        </p>

        \begin{align} &\# \ of \ Connections = C_{n, 2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n - 2)!}
        = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}, \ for \ n \geq 3 \\ &\# \ of \ Internal \
        Connections = C_{n,2} - n = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} - n = \frac{n(n - 3)}{2},
        \ for \ n \geq 3 \end{align}

        <p>
          Notice from above that the number of internal connections also still
          grows quadratically, even though the perimeter grows linearly. This is
          yet another justification for taking a strong stance towards
          connecting knowledge: connecting knowledge grows more quickly than
          gathering knowledge sequentially, although creating the nodes is still
          necessary, of course.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>But why exactly did I choose a hexagon shape for my logo?</em> Is
          it just because it looks symmetrical and kind of nice?
        </p>

        <p>
          Nope. I chose it because it stands in the transition between where
          perimeter connections are more numerous and where inner connections
          start ruling the land. It's the first polygon where the number of
          internal connections are higher than their outer counterparts, as you
          can see from the table below:
        </p>

            <th># of Sides on the Polygon</th>

        <p>The overall shape of the design is settled, so what now?</p>

        <p>
          Here are some extra decisions I had to take in order to get to the end
          result:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I decided to take out the center part of the connected hexagon
            because the outer edges already represent the connections
            sufficiently, and it also seemed to be bloating up the logo, there
            was too much information with it.
          </li>
          <li>
            When coloring, I confess I ran out of ideas. But then I thought:
            running out of ideas should be in the design: how about random,
            pretty colors? So I searched for a nice gradient &mdash; I find that
            <em>good</em> gradients can lend a design smoothness and a sense of
            calmness &mdash;, this set of colors is used a lot in modern app
            design. If you're inclined to interpretations still, I would say the
            light-blue-to-reddish gradient could represent some sort of warm-up,
            in the sense that more connections are activating the global network
            more.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will often see non-pointy designs nowadays, or shapes with
            smoothed corners. That comes from a psychological inclination humans
            have towards pointy objects<foot-note
              text="This I've learned from the &lt;a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/130730.Universal_Principles_of_Design?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=nqTOYJHuH8&rank=1'&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universal Principles of
              Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; book, by Lidwell et al. I've already written an 
              &lt;a href='https://fanaro.io/articles/universal_principles_design/universal_principles_design.html'&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; 
              about that book."
            ></foot-note>
            &mdash; like knives &mdash;, they call our attention because they
            usually represent danger. So, naturally, I, at first, wanted to
            smooth the corners a little bit. However I ultimately reversed my
            decision so the logo would stand out even more. But that's something
            I might change in the future, I don't know.

          So what do you think about my logo and its reasoning? Great? An
          amazing example of overengineering?

            can't &mdash;, but, believe me, you can learn design, with

            the design community has established a rift when it comes to The
            Futur and its creator, Chris Do. Some people think he's a charlatan,
            but I encourage you to evaluate it for yourself, because I certainly
            do not agree with that assertion. Some of Chris' tips helped a lot
            in many aspects of life, so I deem his work as a very valuable asset
            to the community &mdash; for example, watch his

            design work is very simple, and many of his videos are repetitive,
            but the overall product is just priceless.
