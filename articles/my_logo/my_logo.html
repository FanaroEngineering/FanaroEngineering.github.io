      <h1>How I created my logo</h1>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="The Idea"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          The idea behind my logo came to me after struggling with the
          infinitely fragmented knowledge we typically have in schools and
          universities. Centralization and connections within each person's
          knowledge base has since become one of my most important missions.

          Not surprisingly, some people also do get it, and have come to the
          same conclusion, though through very different paths. For example, Dr.
          Alan Watkins<foot-note
            text="If you haven't, go watch his 
            &lt;a href='https://youtu.be/q06YIWCR2Js'&gt;amazing lecture&lt;/a&gt; 
            on how to better perform under pressure."
          ></foot-note
          >, in his book
          <a
            href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18210521-coherence?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=yVDHHh3LV8&rank=2"
            ><em>Coherence</em></a
          >, argues that the challenge of this century will lie on reintegrating
          all of our overspecialized, island fields: we will, as some science
          fiction has already stated, end up
          <em>knowing everything about nothing</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The marketplace seems to be at the culprit, the more specialized you
          are, the more sought after you will be, generic problems can be solved
          by most, after all. However, this can backfire when the complexity of
          the managed system starts to spread along different subjects. That
          might be one of the major causes of why there's usually a critical
          mass or size for many companies, which crumble under their own
          complexity weight, giving rise to usually new and lean competitors.
          The cycle of corporate life repeats, and humans, who have a hard time
          learning from their ancestors' mistakes, will have an even harder time
          learning from their corporate ancestors' mistakes.

          This capitalist problem creeps into universities and schools as well,
          but maybe in a different shape. The more isolated departments are from
          each other the easier it is to justify their own existence and
          budgets, the easier it is to make it hard for others to get anything
          done in your topic.

        <p>
          It's easy to spot why people find it hard and cumbersome to keep
          everything connected. By laying it out in a graph<foot-note
            text="Just a fancy word for a drawing with nodes and connections."
          ></foot-note
          >, we can see that different topics, with typical sequential
          connections, form a polygon. Connecting all of the vertices of a
          polygon seems to grow very quickly as we grow the number of sides.
        </p>

        <!-- TODO: sample graph image -->

        <p>
          That's because they grow quadratically &mdash; \(O(n^2)\) &mdash;, not
          linearly &mdash; \(O(n)\) &mdash;. The number of connections,
          specially the inner ones, as we shall see, grow with the square of the
          number of sides, which is jargon for "boy, do they grow fast". But how
          quickly do they grow, you might ask?
        </p>

        <p>
          It turns out that connecting dots is analogous to making
          <em>combinations</em> of pairs, at least in this case. That means
          order doesn't matter either, so we can use the usual
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"
            >combinatorics formula</a
          ><foot-note
            text="This is coincidentally 
            &lt;a href='https://fanaro.io/articles/scrum_2/scrum_2.html#3-communication-channels-inside-teams-(p-59)'&gt;the same formula used to justify the optimal 
            size of programming teams in Scrum&lt;/a&gt;."
          ></foot-note>
          we learn in high school:
        </p>

        \begin{align} &\# \ of \ Connections = C_{n, 2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n - 2)!}
        = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}, \ for \ n \geq 3 \\ &\# \ of \ Internal \
        Connections = C_{n,2} - n = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} - n = \frac{n(n - 3)}{2},
        \ for \ n \geq 3 \end{align}

        <p>
          Notice from above that the number of internal connections also still
          grows quadratically, even though the perimeter grows linearly. This is
          yet another justification for taking a strong stance towards
          connecting knowledge: connecting knowledge grows more quickly than
          gathering knowledge sequentially, although creating the nodes is still
          necessary, of course.

          <em>But why exactly did I choose a hexagon shape for my logo?</em> Is
          it just because it looks symmetrical and kind of nice?
