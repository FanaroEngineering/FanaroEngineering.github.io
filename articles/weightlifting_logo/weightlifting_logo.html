      <h1>A Weightlifting Logo</h1>

      <p>
        After seeing my previous logo designs &mdash; my
        <local-link
          link="../diy_minimalist_portrait/diy_minimalist_portrait.html"
          text="minimalist self-portrait"
        ></local-link>
        and the
        <local-link
          link="../anti_bullshit_logo/anti_bullshit_logo.html"
          text="Anti Bullshit Bullshit Club"
        ></local-link>
        logos &mdash;, my Olympic Weightlifting coach,
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rogerioweightlifting/"
          >Rogerio Sousa</a
        ><foot-note
          text="Who has been 5x the Brazilian National Champion."
        ></foot-note
        >, asked me if I could make a logo for him.
      </p>

        <img
          class="design-fragments"
          src="Final- Brand Name[1] + Squaring@4x-100.jpg"
          alt="Final Logo"
        />
        <figcaption>
          The image I posted on instagram had slightly worse centering for the
          face. That happened due to a lack of attention when I was finishing
          the design: I put the text in and didn't realize that its center would
          not necessarily coincide with the rest of the image's.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Initially, he gave me a picture with insufficient contrast, which would
        be a lot of work for me, since the Image Trace from Adobe Illustrator
        wouldn't be able to work that well. And, thus, I asked him for a picture
        with more lighting; Image Trace works better when there is great
        contrast for making icons, i.e., extracting the most iconic features of
        the image.

        <img

        />
        <figcaption>The initial picture.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I suggested he took a picture similar to one in which
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/klokovd/">Dmitry Klokov</a>, and
        others, are holding the barbell and the plates trying to emulate a
        warrior's pose.

          src="plate_barbell[5].jpg"
          alt="Plate Barbell Warrior Initial Picture"
        />
        <figcaption>
          The photo we took featured the warrior's pose and much more lighting,
          specially on his face.

        <img
          class="design-fragments"

        />
        <figcaption>
          The bonus logo, an abstraction on the snatch position. The slight
          asymmetry is intentional, I think it gives more realism to the
          picture, although I would probably have to work a bit more on it if I
          were to really use it as a logo for something.

          >I've shared the design process on Instagram</a
        >, but you can also
        <a href="https://youtu.be/NYFPHgGRNaA">check it out on YouTube</a>. As a
        bonus, I've managed to make the snatch logo originally on his T-Shirt
        more abstract and, thus, creating a new logo in and of itself.
