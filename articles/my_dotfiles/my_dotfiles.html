        The repo with my actual dotfiles can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/psygo/dotfiles">here</a>, this is just an
        article to serve as motivation for that repo. In fact, the contents of
        this article might become outdated, and I don't guarantee I'll be
        keeping it up-to-date till the end of time.

        <custom-h2 text="Why Linux?"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          These are the usual reasons people mention as motivation to migrating
          to the Linux ecosystem:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Privacy</li>
          <li>Security</li>
          <li>
            Open Source (mostly) &mdash; or Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
          </li>
          <li>Customization</li>
          <li>Learning more about tech, or investing in your IT career</li>
          <li>Less resources/hardware needed</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Those are all good reasons, but they were not what cut it for me
          actually. Quite frankly, I think the usual lists and blog posts on the
          topic are missing one giant ingredient that could change everyone's
          view of the operating system wars: Linux is at its core a
          <strong>text-based OS</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before I get hatemail from hardcore users saying I'm wrong
          <foot-note text="mimimi"></foot-note>, let me explain what I mean.
          Linux-based distros<foot-note
            text="Short for distribution, or, more simply, OS."
          ></foot-note>
          &mdash; even the ones leaning more heavily on the GUI side, like
          Ubuntu and Mint &mdash; can all be customized to their core with
          text-based configurations, simple files with plain text. That makes
          managing your system much more reproducible and manageable. In more
          mainstream OSs, such as Windows and MacOS, the standard way is through
          GUIs, which makes it harder to customize<foot-note
            text="And vendors will tend to only expose parts of the software 
            through the GUI. Even though that can also be done to text-based 
            configurations, it's usually not part of programming culture to 
            hide useful features from knowledgeable users."
          ></foot-note>
          and remember your configurations, even though, I do admit, it can be
          much easier in the short run.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result, most Linux power users end up being able to centralize
          their files into the typically known as <em>dotfiles repos</em
          ><foot-note
            text="The term dotfiles comes from most Linux configuration files 
            being prefixed by a dot (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;)."
          ></foot-note
          >. This makes sharing configurations with others much easier, not to
          mention that, if you're managing multiple machines, you can
          potentially configure them all with the same file/commands.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having a text-based OS is also very important due to its efficiency:
          you can go through your day using basically only the keyboard. Granted
          that you know how to touch-type, there will also be way less stress on
          your hands and arms.

        <p>The most important components of my setup are:</p>

        <blockquote>
          The whole setup took me almost a semester &mdash; and 300+ commits;
          and a whole lot of other people's tutorials and videos &mdash; to
          solidify, as I discovered new tools created in the last years.
          Hopefully, this article and the above-mentioned repo will help you cut
          through the time I've invested.

            established, minimal ones, like Alacritty. Its author is the same as
            <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>'s, so you can be
            sure it's gonna have a strong open source, and performance core.
            Another important feature, at least to me, is its support for font
            ligatures &mdash; I use
            <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a> &mdash;,

            very frustrated with the lack of keyboard support and care on those
            browsers. I even ended up creating a

            enhance the experience, but they sometimes collide with the
            browser's main, GUI interface. That's when I finally heard about
            qutebrowser, a command/text-based browser. If you're not a Vim user,
            you're gonna struggle with the shortcuts, but you can also use the
            mouse, so it isn't that big a deal &mdash; invest in yourself and
            learn Vim (!). From my experience, some of the shortcuts in
            qutebrowser are not very usable or friendly out of the box, so I
            highly suggest you copy or examine

            appreciate and benefit from this. In terms of security, I think your

            and the project is open source, so anyone can check if they are

          Some other important elements that serve as a complement to some of
          the holes you're still gonna need to fill in order to be a productive
          member of society are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Some special, extra <strong>folders</strong> to help you
            <em>organize</em> things better:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong><code>~/Code/</code></strong
                >: where I centralize all of my code/software projects. Please,
                don't go out spreading/cloning software projects all over your
                system. I'm not saying that putting code elsewhere isn't
                allowed, but I am saying it should be more rare than what you
                think at first. And, by the way, this is a common practice for
                most software engineers I know, even on Windows and MacOS.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><code>~/Notes/</code></strong
                >: my digitized notebook. I currently have more than 3,200
                Markdown notes, which I was previously tracking with
                <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a>. Remember what I said
                about the beauty of having a text-based OS? This is where it can
                shine the most: imagine all of your hard-earned study sessions
                being centralized in one place, all searchable; not to mention
                formattable, taggable and many other "-able"s. I typically use
                <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a>
                to make this easier to work with in the terminal and in Vim.

              <li>
                <strong><code>~/Library/</code></strong

                of books, instead of Calibre &mdash; I still use Google Drive as
                a cloud back up as well. It's a much more viable option than you
                might think. If you want to properly deal with binary files
                through Git, however, you'll have to take a look at
                <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git-LFS</a>.

              >right teacher</a
            >. Most of your research time is actually going to go into
            customizing it, which will eventually make it morph into an IDE.
            Your setup will depend on the languages you use, and your
            objectives, so I guess you're gonna have to do it for yourself. If
            you wish for a starting point, 2 of the most valuable contributors
            in this space are

            my love for Vim has already been declared multiple times throughout
            this article, however, Vim is unfortunately no a silver bullet.
            Especially when it comes to software development. Dealing with
            larger projects and trying to leverage language-specific features is
            still a huge pain, despite Neovim's recent efforts &mdash; it has
            taken more than, what, only 35 years<foot-note
              text="Vim is actually from 1991, but it's based on 1976's Vi, 
              by Bill Joy."
            ></foot-note>
            to get this going? That's where Emacs can find its place. It's a GUI
            editor that isn't limited by the capabilities of your terminal
            emulator, customizable through a much better language (LISP) than
            the horrendous abomination called VimScript<foot-note

              customizability support for any language the user wants."
            ></foot-note

            read and watch a lot of tutorials before commiting to it. One
            YouTube channel that might help you a lot is

            >: I wish Zathura would be enough, because it's a much more minimal
            and keyboard-driven piece of software when compared to Okular.
            However, they seem to have no interest in implementing some core
            features, such as highlighting and proper text-copying. So, in the
            end, I use Zathura for quick lookups and comics; and Okular for
            deeper study sessions. Both support changing text and background
            colors, so you can create a dark mode for any digital document, a
            feature for which my eyes are very thankful.
