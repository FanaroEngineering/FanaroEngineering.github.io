      <blockquote>
        The repo with my actual dotfiles can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/psygo/dotfiles">here</a>, this is just an
        article to serve as motivation for that repo. In fact, the contents of
        this article might become outdated, and I don't guarantee I'll be
        keeping it up-to-date till the end of time.

        <custom-h2 text="Why Linux?"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          These are the usual reasons people mention as motivation to migrating
          to the Linux ecosystem:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Privacy</li>
          <li>Security</li>
          <li>Open Source (mostly)</li>
          <li>Customization</li>
          <li>Learning more about tech | Investing in your IT career</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Those are all good reasons, but they were not what cut it for me
          actually. In fact, I think the usual lists and blog posts on the topic
          are missing one giant ingredient that could change everyone's view of
          the operating system wars: Linux is at its core a
          <strong>text-based OS</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before I start getting the hatemail from hardcore users saying I'm
          wrong, let me explain what I mean. Linux-based distros &mdash; even
          the ones leaning more heavily on the GUI side, like Ubuntu and Mint
          &mdash; can all be customized to their core with text-based
          configurations, simple files with plain text, which makes managing
          your system more reproducible and manageable. In more mainstream OSs,
          such as Windows and MacOS, the standard way is through the GUI, which
          makes it harder to customize and remember your configurations, even
          though, I do admit, it can be much easier in the short run.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result, most Linux power users end up being able to centralize
          their files into the typically known as the <em>dotfiles repo</em>.
          This makes sharing configurations with others much easier, not to
          mention that, if you're managing multiple machines, you can
          potentially configure them all with the same file/commands.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having a text-based OS is also very important due to its efficiency:
          you can go through your day using basically only the keyboard. Granted
          that you know how to touch-type, there will be way less stress on your
          hands.
