      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Recently, I've been spending some time with books on
          craftsmanship<foot-note
            text='Mostly software engineering books, such as

          and

          and, as it was bound to happen, I ended up stumbling upon the source
          for the Myth of Musashi, the legendary &mdash; and greatest &mdash;
          Japanese samurai who served as an inspiration for

            >Eiji Yoshikawa's famous epic</a

          and the manga

            >The Book of Five Rings</a
          >' most well known quotes &mdash; there are many possible translations
          for the phrase &mdash;:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>To know one thing [well] is to know ten thousand.</p>
          <p class="quote-author">Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Could Musashi not only be an entertaining Japanese character but also
          the or a foundation for craftsmanship?
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>1. On Craftsmanship</h2>
        <p>
          Master craftsmanship back in Musashi's period had much in common with
          what we experience nowadays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, there were good and bad practitioners everywhere. If you
          think every samurai carried itself to Musashi-like standards, throw
          your misconceptions away. The main reason for Musashi writing his
          books was to rid the world of the disease of bad technique and bad
          habit<foot-note
            text="We've all been there... In a sense, it is inevitable when you're trying
          something new. But we should always strive for the efficient, which is
          our biggest way of saving time, the only resource we cannot afford.
          "
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Musashi was very pragmatic and completely averse to schools which
          propagated complicated moves or secret techniques. He spends a lot of
          his books' pages trying to convince you that they are actually trying
          to trap you, by making you pay endlessly for whatever it is they
          know<foot-note
            text="The Wind Scroll is only about that basically, so it's at least 20% of
          the content of the The Book of Five Rings."
          ></foot-note
          >. In Niten Ichi-ryu, Musashi's main martial arts school, he
          emphasizes that everything stems from only 5 stances, establishing
          once and for all that swordsmanship comes from simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second of all, Musashi did not think himself superior to others by
          being a samurai. According to him, [Japanese] society had many roles
          mandatory to its existence &mdash; namely: the samurai, the farmer,
          the artisan, and the merchant. What differentiated the samurai was the
          fact that it was an all or nothing occupation, it demanded everything
          from the individual and everything should be channeled at the critical
          moment of the fight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, he does mention many parallels between his craft and others',
          specially when it comes to carpentry. This might not have been the
          case through his entire life, but, after his experience at designing
          the township around the Akashi Castle in 1618, he explicitly starts to
          make analogies with carpenters<foot-note
            text="He was probably making analogies with
          master carpenter-builders, who, back then, used pure carpentry to build
          temples and castles."
          ></foot-note
          >:
        </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          The Way of combat strategy can be likened to the craft of carpentry.
          Comparing samurai with carpenters is related to the subject of
          “houses.” We speak of noble houses, warrior houses and the “Four
          Houses.”<foot-note
            text="A
          reference to the ancient noble families of the Minamoto, Taira, Fujiwara
          and Tachibana. Many warriors could (or claimed to) trace their lineage
          back to one of these four powerful aristocratic families who came to
          prominence during the Heian period (794– 1185). Musashi proudly links
          his ancestry with the Fujiwara clan. Another less likely theory about
          the “Four Houses” is that it refers to the four prevalent schools of the
          tea ceremony: Ura Senke, Omote Senke, Musha-no-Kōji and Yabunouchi.
          (Musashi, Miyamoto. Complete Musashi: The Book of Five Rings and Other
          Works (p. 79). Translation by Alexander Bennett. Tuttle Publishing.)"
          ></foot-note>
          We also talk of the collapse or continuation of a house. In the arts
          we refer to a school or tradition as a house. It is because the label
          “house” is employed as such that I draw parallels with the carpenter’s
          Way. The word “carpenter” (dai-ku) is written with the two ideograms
          meaning “great” and “craft.” The Way of combat strategy is also a
          “great craft,” which is why I relate it to the carpenter’s endowments.
          Study the content of these scrolls carefully if you seek to become
          accomplished in the craft of war. Train assiduously, with the teacher
          serving as the needle and the student as the thread.

          Everyone knows that craftsmanship has immense value, and, yet, we live
          plagued by bad practices &mdash; I'm as guilty as anyone else. Maybe
          we haven't emphasized it enough. And maybe Musashi can help us with
          it. The main mark of a true master writer is exposing the importance
          of what is obvious and, yet, neglected<foot-note

        <h2>2. The Critical Moment</h2>
        <p>
          Another very famous quote is the one featured in many Kendo dojos
          &mdash; despite the fact that they more often than not don't really
          follow any of Musashi's schools, which is actually quite the
          compliment &mdash;:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>One thousand days of training to forge,</p>
          <p>Ten thousand days of training to refine.</p>
          <p>But a [Kendo] bout is decided in a split second.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The quote above, among other things, talks about the importance of
          putting everything you've got into the decisive split second that will
          decide the fight. Failing the split second critical moment is failing
          your entire life, thus putting your entire life's work in the trash
          can. Of course, this is a little bit of an exaggeration since we can
          salvage a lot even if you fail hard at the critical juncture, but how
          many times in your life have you failed at the critical moment and it
          felt like every second you spent training and studying went
          immediately up to smoke?
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish I had emphasized this more in my life and I believe you wish so
          too. Being an athlete of mostly endurance-based sports, this was
          specially hard for me to grasp throughout the last 5 years of my life.
          Initially, I was completely averse to the whole concept, as it seemed
          completely opposite to everything my coaches had ever taught me: be
          consistent, keep a constant pace and victory will come inevitably,
          with patience. But perhaps endurance-based sports aren't, at the very
          least not always, the best analogy for life<foot-note
            text="I'm not trying to diminsh
        these sports' value. Every ideology has its deficiencies. For example,
        many adherents of power-based sports have huge mental and physical
        difficulties when dealing with endurance-based tasks."
          ></foot-note
          >. And there are critical moments even in marathons: how many times
          did a majestic run turned out to be a silver medal because the athlete
          kept her pace but was overwhelmed by another athlete applying
          everything she had at the critical moment?<foot-note
            text="The run was only majestic because our
        sense of beauty is deeply linked with how constant the athlete's pace
        is."
          ></foot-note>
        </p>
        <p>
          Another more usual example of how the critical moment emphasis could
          improve our performance is presentations and or lectures. It is not
          common for a class to have a background linear pace, which gives the
          impression that everything in it is of equal importance &mdash; or,
          perhaps, that nothings is important. But this isn't the case 99% of
          the time, is it? Every topic has usually 2 or 3 concepts accounting
          for the vast majority of its contents. Change the temporal pace when
          approaching these, spend more effort, give temporal emphasis to them,
          and watch comprehension and attention spike afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some 4 years ago I had my first encounter with a close relative of
          that Musashi quote in a probably unconscious analogy with Go and life.
          In a tournament in London, I was fortunate enough to have my game
          reviewed by Catalin Taranu 5p<foot-note
            text="If you're not familiar with Go: the &quot;p&quot; denotes
        a professional dan rank, which is equivalent to a black belt.
        Professional rankings are typically much harder than amateurs'. In this
        case, the player is a professional black belt of the 5th degree. The
        maximum level for a professional is 9p."
          ></foot-note>
          and, when the game ended, after reflecting upon the huge lead changes,
          he mentioned something one of his Japanese senseis once taught him:
        </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          A Go game is like life, there are a few critical instants in a sea of
          unimportant moments in-between.
        </p>
        <p>
          What it was meant to teach is that, much like life, Go has moves or
          moments in which the value of success or failure is way higher than
          the average moment of the game. It is very important for us to
          identify those moments and anticipate them so we can focus better and
          channel everything we've got into them, the rest of the game might
          suffer from our inevitable lack of energy, but that's well worth
          it<foot-note
            text="When
        analyzing variations, maybe we should put some more effort into
        highlighting which moves in the tree are very important, so we at least
        know when to focus more when facing them in games. We could also
        alternate systematically between a breadth-first search (BFS) and a
        depth-first search (DFS) of the variations tree in order to get a fuller
        comprehension of the patterns. Computer science trees and memorization
        studies in the field of psychology would come in handy here."
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>
        Musashi elaborates further on this; in the Fire Scroll of Gorin-No-Sho
        (The Book of Five Rings), in the subsection about "Traversing Critical
        Points" (4):
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            In swordsmanship and in the midst of pitched battle, the ability to
            know the right moment to traverse a critical point is essential.
            Know the enemy’s strengths and have a firm grasp of your own
            capabilities.
          </p>
          <p class="quote-author">

            Other Works (p. 111). Translation by Alexander Bennett. Tuttle

          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          One of the ways of improving your performance when the critical moment
          arises is by being conscious about it. It's easy to take the path of
          artificially making everything homogeneous and simply keep moving  as
          usual. But, when the time comes, if you can, just stop, take a step
          back, breath consistently to lower the heart rate variance &mdash; no
          need for deep breaths actually: watch
          <a href="https://youtu.be/q06YIWCR2Js">this lecture</a> by Dr. Alan
          Watkins for more details &mdash; and, only then, make a move. In Go
          tournaments, from what I experienced throughout more than 5 years of
          playing and achieving dan levels, this would be revolutionary for
          almost every player if done right, even those much stronger than me.
        </p>
        <p>
          For tasks in which you don't have the luxury of pausing, you will need
          to find ways of  training the switch from focus on the pace to focus
          on bursts of extra effort. Create a test harness or laboratory for
          your task or sport<foot-note
            text="From the technological perspective, this harness or
        laboratory might be worth much more than your performance, both for
        commercial use or society itself."
          ></foot-note
          >. Be conscious that your pace cannot extract every last drop of
          effort you have, i.e., you will need an edge for the critical moments,
          and it will be worth sacrificing some of the pace for it &mdash; the
          surprise factor alone can justify the sacrifice, even though it will
          never be appealing to purists &mdash;:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Traverse the peril at the optimum point just as a worthy mariner
            navigates ocean routes. Once crossed, the mind becomes tranquil. If
            you successfully get past the critical point, your opponent will
            tire, the initiative will be yours and victory is there for the
            taking.

          Another technique I've found to be very useful and have been recently
          experimenting with is one explored by performance coach Todd Herman:
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Alter-Ego-Effect-Identities-Transform-ebook/dp/B075WPWMSK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1585519202&amp;sr=1-2"
            >The Alter Ego Effect</a
          >. As the Academy of Ideas explains in
          <a href="https://youtu.be/U0BmtjNgOak">this video</a>, the Alter Ego
          Effect tries to leverage a second ideal self for us to be able to
          achieve our goals without having to deal with our usual self-doubt and
          anxiety. By acting as our ideal self we can ditch our worries and
          commitments and only focus on the task at hand. This may appear silly
          at first but has had tremendous results with high performance athletes
          and is a de facto technique used and recommended by philosophers and
          psychologists.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, this whole discussion on critical points could also be
          seen as an application of a 4-dimensional perspective of life. We are
          beings in 4 dimensions in fact, 3 spatial and 1 temporal. Why do we
          put so much stress and importance on space and, so often, leave time
          to a secondary role?<foot-note
            text="We don't usually see time as a dimension, probably because
        we can only move forward in it and it seems so much out of our control.
        But we can control when we will act in the future, just like we can
        choose our location in space. And, regarding the strangeness of the time
        dimension, we have another dimension that is, for the most part, very
        weird also: height. Why do we have to spend so much more effort to move
        around it? Gravity can make routine quite weird also, we're just used to
        it."

        <h2>3. About The Translations of Musashi's Books</h2>
        <p>
          Be very mindful that a lot of Musashi's books' contents were lost
          throughout the ages and we will never know their true content, since
          they were, for a long time, only passed on from grandmaster to
          grandmaster, with various editions in-between. Hence, you should be
          very careful when choosing a translation and source for the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ultimately chose to go for

          while learning Japanese and its culture. Besides also having learned
          from past translations' mistakes, Bennett has a secret weapon in his
          arsenal:
          <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/authordata/uozumi-takashi/"
            >Prof. Uozumi Takashi</a
          >, from both the Open University of Japan and the Internation Budo
          University.
        </p>
        <p>
          Takashi is supposedly the world's foremost expert on Musashi and has
          done probably the most scientific work on the topic. After years
          looking for the original manuscripts and not finding any confirmation
          of their existence, he has taken all of the most trustworthy copies
          and interpolated them in order to find their mistakes and, hopefully,
          uncover the original text from cross-checking all of the various
          posterior editions<foot-note
            text="A sort of Game of 7 Errors with no original image to base yourself on."
          ></foot-note
          >. By doing so, for example, he was able to find out the truly most
          likely birth and birthplace of Musashi, the latter being a huge recent
          source for scamming tourists.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a bonus for Bennett's book, you also get the other Musashi books,
          with meta-references to their counterparts in the main Book of Five
          Rings.

        <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          Despite Musashi's works being amazing and perhaps mandatory for any
          proud craftsman, I would say they are outdated and insufficient. Times
          and technologies have changed a lot and the context of swordsmanship
          isn't that generic sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way the book is written also doesn't help very much. It's overall
          superficial and so fragmented that changing the context takes most of
          your concentration time. Besides all that, it is trying to do
          something very difficult to achieve: explain martial arts in words. It
          wasn't meant to be a textbook for beginners but rather for experts, so
          that's a concession we have to make.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of Musashi's books that is sometimes forgotten is actually a very
          iconic one: <em>Dokkodo</em> or <em>The Path Walked Alone</em>. In it,
          at his deathbed, he listed 21 principles to live your life by. Some of
          the more unusual ones are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I harbored no biased feelings.
            <ul>
              <li>
                One of the instances in which this comes into play is when
                discussing preferences for different techniques. A big part of
                Musashi's school is to not have preferences, your moves should
                be dictated by the circumstances only; those who blindly follow
                the way of the long sword only will be killed in closed
                quarters; and, conversely, those who follow the way of the short
                sword only will die by the spear.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            I steered clear of the path to attachment.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attachment in this context, according to Bennett, means falling
                in love, which is a considerable deviation from the more usual
                Romantic love or Ancient Greek love in Western societies. An
                interesting fact is that there are no historical records about
                Musashi having a partner at all, not even casual intercourse
                with prostitutes.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            I cared not where I lived.
            <ul>
              <li>
                As a samurai, he was basically a nomad, serving different lords
                throughout his life. But this was not an annoyance or burden to
                him, it actually made him more free as an individual. As many
                Cynic philosophers of Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire would
                have converged: having too many possessions is actually being
                the one possessed by.

          Before you leave, I hope I have convinced you enough to join the
          unofficial Ridding the World of Bad Practices Club. We have quite some
          high-caliber members and we are always open to criticism. Personally,
          my life's purpose depends on this membership, and I think society
          could benefit a lot from us having more members.

        <h2>5. Further Reading</h2>
        <p>
          Read about efficiency. That's what Musashi's book is ultimately about
          when generalized to other crafts. His work was an attempt at cleaning
          up all of the dirt and bad habits left throughout the ages, only
          leaving the bare minimum which we need to learn in order to achieve
          our goals in the most efficient manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many books will be specific to whatever area you're interested in, but
          there are those which can be applied to any area of interest; some
          that come to mind are:

          Musashi also believed that the samurai was two-fold &mdash; the pen
          and the sword &mdash; and, so, he also managed to be a master painter
          and calligrapher. You can read more about it in
