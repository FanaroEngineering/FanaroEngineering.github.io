      <h1>Less Pain: Make Your Office More Comfortable and Ergonomic</h1>

      <p>
        Like many of you, I've experienced a lot of issues with (im)proper
        posture while using my workplace office setting. I've had to go to
        massage parlors in order to alleviate the pain I had accumulated in my
        trapezius muscles. But, luckily, I've come across some very nice tips
        recently, and most of them come from this video from the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ"
          >Wall Stree Journal Youtube Channel</a

        As an extra, more specifically, if you're suffering from the same
        trapezius pain I used to have, your keyboard is probably at a higher
        level than it should be. This forces your shoulders to go up,
        contracting your trapezius. Another thing I've managed to diagnose in my
        case is that sometimes I tend to rest my head on one of my hands while
        using the table to support my body. This puts a lot of stress on only
        one side of my trapezius and, eventually, I developed a lot of pain on
        my left trapezius &mdash; the right hand is usually in charge of the
        mouse &mdash;, which also happened to propagate towards my inner back
        muscles.

        There are two other videos in that same channel that are also worth the
        watch, and which are listed below:
