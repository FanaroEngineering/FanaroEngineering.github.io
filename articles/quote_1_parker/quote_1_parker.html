        on quotes which had a lot of impact on me and which, hopefully, might
        help you as well. I'm going to try to not only throw quotes on you but
        provide a context and other useful surrounding information that might be
        able to enforce even more the wisdom behind these pearls of human
        knowledge.

        The first one is the extremely simple &mdash; some might say that the
        writer's job is to simply put the obvious in evidence... &mdash;:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a
        room alone.
        <p class="quote-author">
          Blaise Pascal, <em>Pensées</em>, 1670<foot-note
            text="&lt;em&gt;Pensées&lt;/em&gt; is
            actually a posthumous book, Pascal died before completing it."
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

      There are some highlights to this deceptively simple quote which need
      emphasizing so they don't go unnoticed:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Already at least since the 1670's, humanity's inability to focus was
          patent, even when it comes to geniuses such as Blaise Pascal &mdash;
          he might not have had this problem actually, he might have been
          referring to his colleagues only, but I will assume he was human like
          us.
        </li>
        <li>
          The same message is found in many other artists' works. One funny
          example comes from the witty 20th century American writer Dorothy
          Parker:
          <em>writing is the art of applying the ass to the seat</em
          ><foot-note
            text="The
          image thumbnail is my design, Mrs. Parker might have not approved
          capturing herself taking a look at that juicy ass."
          ></foot-note
          ><em>.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          In
          <a
            href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-07-19/new-study-found-people-are-terrible-sitting-alone-their-thoughts-how-about-you"
            >a recent study</a
          >, psychologists have found that our difficulties with respect to
          dealing with our own thoughts are so prevalent that we would rather
          receive physical pain than endure them. As I've learned during some of
          my loneliest moments of my one-year engineering exchange in Europe:
          you can change your country, friends and colleagues,
          <em
            >but you will never escape from yourself and your own thoughts.</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Personally, what I take from this quote &mdash; and hope you do as
          well &mdash; is a very important reassurance from an accomplished
          master: if I do put the effort of applying my ass to the seat, I will
          eventually, at some point &mdash; fingers crossed &mdash;, be able to
          solve my problems.
