This problem comes from [Wang Zhi et al.'s *1000 Cases for Tsume-Go* (ISBN 7810514296)\][wang_zhi_link\], but the comments and diagrams have been completely created by me, Philippe Fanaro.

This type of liberty race is an example of the recursion. Without `B`, it would take 8 liberties to capture `A`, and, internally, the recaptures will have 5 and 3 liberties respectively.

Black's Internal Liberties: (stones up to atari - 1) + previous case of the recursion - `B` stone = (4 - 1) + 5 - 1 = 7.

White's Liberties (after filling up ▲, and with sente): 3 external + Nakade \\#4 - 2 = 3 + 5 - 2 = 3 + 3 = 6

So Black wins the race by 1 liberty &mdash; can't tenuki.]LB[po:A][rn:B]TR[qp][rp][sp];W[qp];B[nq];W[rp];B[no];W[sp]C[It will take 9 moves or 7 liberties &mdash; that's a "formula" for the big eye dead shape at `C` &mdash; to capture `A`, and the same for White.

The same goes for Black, but it's Black's turn.]LB[rr:A];B[rr];W[rs];B[sr];W[rm]C[Again, White plays a sente move, so it should not be counted because it only affects the local group and not the liberty race as a whole.];B[qn];W[rn]C[So far, this is the 5th move White has played to try to capture Black. If, after `A` or `B`, Black chooses to capture the 2 stones, nothing will change with respect to its total of liberties, because, after applying the same "sente-doesn't-count" logic, Black has only 2 more liberties anyway.]LB[rm:B][sn:A];B[rr];W[ss];B[rr])(;B[rm]BM[1]TR[qp][rp][sp]LB[rn:C][sl:B][sr:A];W[qn]C[`A` is filling in a liberty, while `B` would have preserved it. Alternatively, it also creates a smaller internal eye than with `B`.

- Black's Liberties: Nakade \\#4 - 2 (`C`) + 1 (`B`) = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4

- White's Liberties (after filling up ▲ and with sente): Nakade \\#4 - 2 (`D`) + 3 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5

Note that White used its initial sente on the race to play `C`, so Black will be able to fill an extra liberty externally when compared to the variation on the correct answer.]LB[qn:C][rm:A][sl:B][sr:D]TR[qp][rp][sp];B[nq]C[Following from the main variation's explanations, we have that, after White fills up all of the ▲ liberties:

- White: 2 external liberties + 3 internal (`A`) = 5.

It's White's turn, and she has 1 extra liberty on this race, so White can even tenuki.]LB[qn:C][sl:B][sr:A]TR[qp][rp][sp]HO[1];W[aa];B[no];W[sl];B[pr];W[qp];B[ps];W[rp];B[nn];W[sp];B[np];W[qm];B[sn];W[qn];B[rr];W[rs];B[sr];W[qm];B[rn];W[qm]))
