        steroids, though there are more recent spin-offs of that masterpiece.

        was written by Gabriel Wyner, an engineer turned opera singer who, after
        long years of struggle trying to learn languages, found himself in the
        urgent situation of having to quickly learn multiple of them in order to
        enter the world of professional opera singers. Gabriel tells a story
        very similar to my experience with German, where he, for years, had
        Russian lessons that simply used rote memorization, and which,
        inevitably, yielded tragic results: not much beyond the alphabet and
        some common phrases and nouns were learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Years later, he had to learn German, but this time it had to be with a
        different approach. It wasn't as if he knew what he was doing but this
        experience would shine a light in his head about how to become fluent in
        any language. During weeks he went into an immersion program in the
        famous Middlebury College<foot-note
          text="Middlebury College is famous for
        training interpreters... and being a hotspot for CIA recruitment."
        ></foot-note>
        where he could only speak the foreign language he had signed up for
        &mdash otherwise he would be expelled from the campus until the end of
        the program. Although he didn't stress it much, that period would serve
        to illustrate his<em>
          principle of avoiding translations when learning a new language</em
        >, even if you don't understand anything of what you're hearing. He
        argues that, at first, you should learn the blunt sounds of the
        language, because not only is it easier to learn a new language when
        remarkable sounds come into play &mdash they help memories become more
        memorable &mdash, but they also help you disconnect the crutches of
        bridging everything you learn into your native language. This
        disconnection will free your thoughts and maximize learning efficiency.
        Of course, thankfully, he doesn't go into fascist mode and says we
        should abandon translation absolutely, only that we should avoid it
        whenever possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second principle that underpins his whole book is probably even more
        important and less intuitive to discover how to apply:
        <em>make memories more memorable</em>. Each grammatical construction,
        word or phrase is a memory in your head; and, thus, the least
        attachment, personal connection, they have with you, the less likely
        they will go out of the short memory buffer and enter the long memory
        hard-drive. He cites a lot of research he has gathered over the years in
        order to make this point &mdash which is probably the most crucial of
        the book &mdash, and, in the end, the simple solution to end our
        memorization problems is to come up with a systematic way of creating
        effective memories<foot-note
          text="When creating memories, our ineffectiveness
        usually stems from the fact that we are simply trying to keep them by
        only their structure and sound. It would in fact be much more effective
        if we used a conceptual or abstract discussion (putting the new word
        into a higher order hierarchical drawer); or, &lt;em&gt;better yet,&lt;/em&gt; a
        personal connection."
        ></foot-note
        >. In his experience, the best way to do so is to use
        <em>Flash Cards</em> &mdash software like
        <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, or, equivalently, a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system">Leitner Box</a>,
        help optimize this process &mdash to stimulate recalling<foot-note
          text="&lt;em&gt;Recall&lt;/em&gt;: do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Memorize&lt;/em&gt;."
        ></foot-note>
        sessions of the memories, something that will work best only if you add
        something memorable to each card &mdash for example, in order to
        remember the word "fire", you might put a picture of the Great Fire of
        Rome caused by the ancient Roman Emperor Nero. Due to the importance of
        flash cards, he probably spends 30-40% of the book on techniques to
        optimize their use, which, albeit very important indeed, does become a
        bit mechanical and uninteresting after a while, especially if you're not
        practicing what he teaches as you read.

      <p>
        In order to drive his point about memorization with Spaced Repetition
        Systems (of which flash cards is an example) home, he cites a lot of
        research, but the main one comes from the German psychologist
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus"
          >Hermann Ebbinghaus</a
        >. Ebbinghaus became famous after painstakingly memorizing nonsensical
        syllables (<em>dax</em>, <em>bok</em>, <em>yat, etc...</em>) in order to
        create the graph now known as the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve"
          ><em>Forgetting Curve</em></a
        ><foot-note
          text="Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve is often cited as one of the most
        ingenious investigations ever. Despite its inherent herculean effort and
        creativity, however, statistically, it is quite flawed. After all, it is
        only analyzing Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve and not the average human
        being's. In order for it to reach complete statistical validity, the
        experiment should have been applied to other people and averaged out."

        >. This curve shows how much content we can retain in our memory after a
        given time since we've learned it. Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) base
        themselves on this curve: whenever the content retained reaches a
        certain level, we <em>recall</em> our memories via some registry &mdash
        e.g. flash cards &mdash and reset our memories until the content finally
        reaches our long-term memory, something that is illustrated in the
        picture below.

      <p>
        All in all, I would give this book 4.5 stars due to the excessive
        unnecessary sections on flash cards; it seemed the author wanted the
        book to be longer for some reason. Since 4.5 stars is usually not
        possible in most websites, I'm gonna give it some slack and round it up
        to 5 stars. It's a great book, an absolute must for anyone trying to be
        more efficient when learning a new language (or simply memorizing
        stuff); and I also would really like to investigate the interesting
        references more.
