          For probably about 10 years I've been hearing this fallacy, and I
          cannot believe it sometimes comes out from some quite erudite people;
          lately I've been hearing it even from more intellectual Youtube
          channels such as
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NTDChinaUncensored"
            >China Uncensored</a
          >
          &mdash; of which I'm a subscriber and fan. The typical phrasing is
          something like "that's what you get for choosing communism<foot-note
            text='I&apos;m gonna be
        using socialism and communism interchangeably here because everyone
        seems to do so, although we can always go down the rabbit hole of their
        differences. In sum, most of the dictatorships people seem to despise
        were or are actually &lt;em&gt;communist&lt;/em&gt;, because it is the state that
        owns all the economic resources. For more info, check

        &gt;.'
          ></foot-note
          >: only death" or "why would you choose socialism? Look at the hundred
          million deaths<foot-note
            text="Some people even go as far as mentioning suffering
        alongside death. However, as we will see this will further weaken the
        argument."
          ></foot-note>
          all of these regimes have caused...".
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, okay... you're gonna say that, as statements of facts, those are
          more or less correct, because communism or socialism did kill a lot of
          people. However, whenever people invoke those arguments, the
          comparison to the status quo, i.e. some variation of capitalism, is
          definitely implicit and, as we will see, that does lead to false
          conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I usually don't even know where to start with this kind of reasoning
          and end up sounding like some sort of anti-capitalist or flat out
          strike organizer. But, before you think I'm a staunch supporter of
          socialism or brutal dictatorships, let me tell you that I'm not: I'm,
          at best, a fan of logic. And that's the core problem here: sponsoring
          this fallacy is playing &mdash; often unconsciously &mdash; on
          emotions to sell the propaganda of an economic system, not analyzing
          the facts.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Pressured by external and internal forces, the government would be
            forced into taking more and more extreme actions, killing many of
            its citizens in the name of the revolution and implementing an
            atmosfere of extreme distrust and censorship.

        <p>
          Usually people blatantly tag socialism or communism as something
          inherently wrong and, thus, bound to fail. However, it is only an
          ideology, a plethora of ideas, and these ideas are only as extreme as
          the ideal capitalism some hypocritical economists seem to propagate as
          reality. A perfectly autruistic society probably never existed (for
          long), and there will probably never be a perfectly balanced market
          either, so long as there are cheaters in this world or so long as we
          let businesses influence politics.
        </p>
        <p>
          These plethoras of ideas need to face reality at some point and that's
          how they fail; and fail hard sometimes. For example, we haven't yet
          been able to even conceive a market where the government would not
          have to correct the course in which companies regularly abuse their
          power to the detriment of the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mostly, these implementation failures come from the ideas' neglect of
          many other important variables. In the case of communism, the biggest
          variable theories underestimated was corruption: the infamous
          politburos would not, in the end, fight for the people, but rather for
          their own interests, with infinite attempts at perpetuating their own
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this not so mentioned implementation flaw, there is another
          huge variable shallow analysts and the biased media seem to ignore
          frequently: outside influence. Can anyone imagine the pressure the
          USSR must have faced by going against the <em>entire world</em> and
          institutionalizing a completely different system? Every day there
          would be numerous attempts at destabilizing the government, and from
          completely different countries. No wonder the KGB quickly became the
          most powerful secret agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Little by little, the capitalist world chipped away the allure of
          socialism &mdash; through words or products &mdash; from the Russians,
          Slavs, Eastern Germans, and others. Little by little did the USSR
          increase their surveillance and punishment to those who spoke ill of
          the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove that this phenomenon is not an exception, a very specific
          instance or something else entirely, let's take a look at an "entirely
          different situation": the French Revolution of 1789. An analogous
          pressure was felt among the rebels with respect to the outside
          influence: all over Europe, monarchies would soon flock to the rescue
          of French royalty, fearing the spread of such a rebellion. The
          disgraced royalty would try to gather forces in order to undo the coup
          d'état. Little by little, an atmosfere of distrust ensued and the
          rebels had to gradually and quickly take more and more severe actions
          against anyone who would dare doubt them. Throughout the continent,
          from various countries, powerful politicians would declare the
          revolution an abomination, a new system that usurped the glory
          nobility perpetuated. Sounds familiar? If you're still rooting for the
          main fallacy: your cries against socialism could have sounded as
          strange to future humanity, as the nobles' cries against democracy and
          capitalism back then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only 5 years after the revolution, Robespierre, one of its most
          renowned leaders, was executed by the guillotine. About a decade after
          the start of the whole chaotic ordeal, Napoléon Bonaparte would be
          crowned the Emperor of France. Somehow, it should seem miraculous that
          most of the world lives under democracies and not monarchies. Somehow,
          we have convinced ourselves that the exact same phenomenon was brave
          in the context of the French Revolution and hideous, logically invalid
          in the context of the USSR.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both contexts are different and I'm not here to defend the Stalin's
          brutalities on the back of the French Revolution. But it should be
          flagrant that people seem to inflate brutalities when the outcome is
          bad and deflate them when things turned out to be successful.

          If deaths could comprise the hardship and complexities of living under
          economic systems, we wouldn't really need a debate, we would just
          (carefully) count them and game over. But deaths are just a huge
          oversimplification; and, even though I do agree that communism has
          really gone to extremes never before seen during Stalin and Mao, it
          would be very <em>naïve or ill-intentioned</em> to ignore the terrible
          background capitalist feats when it comes to the quality of living.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true that the current system has managed to improve our lives
          beyond our wildest imaginations &mdash; if you have the money that
          is... &mdash;, however this was not simply only an achievement of will
          or intellectual prowess on the part of the most developed countries,
          it was mostly built on the backs of the millions and billions living
          in the poorest countries. In the last century, the rich bathed in
          comfort while poverty was exported to the far away corners of the
          world, in Southeast Asia, Africa and South America.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most notable case of hypocrisy is probably the abusive British
          colonial rule of India. The English would regularly exploit the
          country for food, causing huge famines in various regions and in
          different periods. The current estimate of the number of deaths is at
          35 million people. This no small number, it's doubling
          Hitler's<foot-note
            text="One important
        fact I didn't discuss in this article is that, despite not having the
        biggest absolute numbers, Hitler was indeed probably the winner when it
        comes to the worst dictator, mostly because he killed at a much higher
        pace a much higher ratio of his and other populations &mdash; another
        terrible example is Pol Pot, who killed about 30% of his own Cambodian
        population. Percentages are another deep discussion, so I'm going to
        leave it aside this article this time."

          death toll and 1.5 times Stalin's hideous achievement. And the English
          didn't stop there: during World War II, they forcefully recruited
          millions 2.5 million Indian soldiers and, while in shortage of food
          for their army, caused 4 million people to die of famine
          (again)<foot-note
            text="And that's only one British colony, where do we even start with the Middle East?"
          ></foot-note
          >. The British still sneakily try to diverge from having these facts
          publicized to the world and, in the meanwhile, let Hollywood make
          endless movies about American heroism in a war where only

          Famine or no famine, Indians will breed like rabbits.
          <p>Winston Churchill</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Winston Churchill was even worse than you imagine when it comes to
          Indians. After refusing American and Canadian food aid to India and
          being asked why &mdash; food supplies to Europe had already been sent
          &mdash;, he replied: "if there is a shortage then why is Gandhi still
          alive?"
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it.
          <p>Winston Churchill</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Another less known brutal ruler was Leopold II of Belgium. During the
          colonial European rush of the late 1800s, Belgium managed to get its
          hands on Congo, where a brutal system was imposed, leading to internal
          wars and, again, huge famines. In total, it's estimated that Belgium
          has managed to destroy up to 15 million lives &mdash; mutilation of
          children included &mdash; as a result of either direct actions or the
          sponsorship of internal conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          To further illustrate that deaths as a metric system is completely
          incompetent for the argument, we can also mention the South American
          dictatorships dating from the 1960s to the early 1990s. While trying
          to fight USSR's influence in the continent after the Cuban disaster,
          the USA undercut its own principles and sponsored several coup d'états
          all over the continent<foot-note
            text="There are numerous secret documents, which were
        inevitably made public in the last two decades by the CIA, proving the
        USA's part in the coups. So there is virtually no room for deniers."
          ></foot-note
          >, installing brutal dictators who would perpetuate the exact same
          methods of torture, censorship and killing the USSR was known for. The
          death tolls were not in the same magnitude of prior atrocities, but
          what about the freedoms lost? The shattered families? The brainwashing
          of the people? These regimes weren't even capable to stand for
          themselves, leaving their countries with frail or completely destroyed
          economies. Once the US decided to withdraw their aid, those
          governments collapsed.

        <p>
          The main reason people can't seem to get their numbers right is
          related to what was discussed in the previous section: only deaths
          caused by conflicts approved by the status quo seem to make the bill.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you sum the deaths caused by iconic communist dictators, the total
          is probably around 100 to 120 million<foot-note
            text="Up to 25 million for Stalin, up
        to 90 million for Mao and some other millions for various other
        dictators. Personally, I would actually put this number at around 150

        wouldn't change by much."

          >, and that would even be called a bit of an overestimation by some.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, when summing up only some of the major conflicts
          capitalism has caused throughout more or less the last 150 years, the
          total can easily surpass the socialist counterpart:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>40 million: World War I</li>
          <li>
            55 million: World War II. Should I mention the fact that both World
            Wars were mainly caused by capitalist strife between Europeans? Or
            that many huge US companies helped the Nazis, only stopping when the
            government forced them to?<foot-note
              text="IBM (under Thomas Watson), General
          Motors, Ford (under Henry Ford himself) and the Associated Press are
          some of the most (in)famous examples."
            ></foot-note>
          </li>
          <li>
            10 million: Leopold II of Belgium's rule of Congo (I'm trying to be
            a bit more conservative than 15 million)
          </li>
          <li>35 million: Indians lost by famine during British rule</li>
          <li>
            4 million: Indians lost by famine due to increased British food
            demand in World War II
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The list is only a brief summary of some conflicts and we are already
          at 144 million deaths for capitalism. I've even ignored plenty of
          other conflicts in the Middle East, the abominable European economic
          wonders slavery provided, and all of the nastiness the Japanese Empire
          (1868 - 1947) caused Southeast Asia from the beginning of the 1900s to
          1947. It's also not at all difficult to imagine another 100
          million<foot-note

        number is extremely difficult to calculate, and different sources will

            official" sources state that, under Mao, only 20 million people were

        <custom-h2 text="Conclusion"></custom-h2>
        <p>
          People should care very little if you don't like socialism, communism
          or capitalism, they are only choices on the spectrum. Ultimately, all
          of those systems have worthy goals, worthy ideas, despite the
          implementations' faults. Nevertheless, what you should definitely care
          about is if the reason for the dislike comes from emotion or
          propaganda, instead of logic. The moment you fall into the trap, it
          won't be you or your reasoning who's in control, but rather the
          (powerful) people who want to perpetuate the(ir) status quo.
        </p>
        <p>
          In sum, all I have to ask is: if you wish to continue arguing against
          socialism or communism, be my guest, but do it with another argument,
          a logical one this time.
