      <h1>The Left Hand of Darkness, and SciFi</h1>

      <p>
        <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em>, by Ursula Le Guin, is a Science
        Fiction (SciFi) book originally published in 1969. At the time, Le Guin
        was one of the authors who helped revitalize the genre from outdated to
        the behemoth it is today. Now, the Penguin Group is republishing it in a
        collector’s edition, alongside five other remarkabale classics of the
        same era and genre: <em>The Once and Future King</em>, by T. H. White;
        <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em>, by Robert A. Heinlein;
        <em>Dune</em>, by Frank Herbert; 2001: <em>A Space Odyssey</em>, by
        Arthur C. Clarke; and <em>Neuromancer</em>, by William Gibson &mdash;
        Penguin, apparently, used to have the highest rated SciFi on the market,
        but has since then diverged into other areas.

        The main theme of the <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> is not only an
        other-worldly culture but, more importantly, the ambisexual "humans"
        that populate it. Genly Ai, the protagonist, is an envoy of a far away
        alliance of planets tasked with the challenge of convincing the people
        of the planet Gethen to join its eighty-something other worlds in a
        somewhat utopian cultural, technological and mystical experience
        throughout the cosmos. The difficulty of Ai’s mission mostly comes from
        the consequences of the locals’ lack of sexual differentiation: social
        rituals and manners are always catching him off-guard, and a method for
        achieving and maintaining social prestige, <em>shifgrethor</em>, seems
        to be excessively counter-intuitive for him. On top of all that, he has
        to deal with the delicate ego balance of a mentally unstable king and a
        rival country ruled by a fearful bureaucracy.

        The ideas which propelled the novel in the 1969 were what piqued my
        interest, but also what disappointed me the most in reading the book. Le
        Guin created a plethora of social behaviors and environments as
        consequences of a unigendered society, but none of them seem to have a
        strong logical reasoning, they feel like random thoughts on what such a
        world would be like. The biggest example of this absence of
        justifications is probably one of the core concepts of the book:
        <em>shifgrethor</em> social transactions are all based on it, but not
        even once is there a clear-cut image of what it is; Ai seems to always
        point out situations when the natives would act in a certain manner
        while intending a completely different message, leaving us totally in
        the dark as to what this <em>shifgrethor</em> practice means. Obviously,
        Le Guin, in an anthropological style, tried to show us an authentic
        portrait of what a discoverer would encounter; however, it fails to
        convince, it feels like a poorly performed magic trick.

        We go along the book reading countless times about the protagonist’s awe
        and puzzlement with respect to how much different a genderless society
        is &mdash; e.g., "one is respected and judged only as a human being. It
        is an appalling experience" &mdash;, but seldom is there a big enough
        digression with interesting thoughts on how this difference came to be,
        only very superficial, basic, conclusions, completely incompatible with
        what we would expect from an envoy of a galactic alliance. The main
        character &mdash; and the reader &mdash; will never fully manage to well
        understand the local cultures nor its origins; and that, coupled with
        the lacking of a structural and comprehensive description or exploration
        of this societal variation leaves a feeling of incompleteness, of a book
        that did not quite manage to fulfill its promise &mdash; in the 1960s,
        perhaps this miscellanea would be enough for an audience with very
        little experience on gender ideas, but nowadays it is definitely
        insufficient. It is quite clear to me that this book needed more pages;
        in fact, if I didn’t know it was a book, I would say it was a chapter or
        part of another much bigger work.

      <p>
        My critique has not yet made justice to the saga’s strength though, and
        I must say that at least some of it is very much worth reading and
        learning from. By far, the best &mdash; and worthwhile &mdash; part of
        the whole story is around the last 70 pages, where the main character
        and his companion &mdash; who takes turns in narrating the story &mdash;
        attempt an escape in a fiercely desolate landscape, an environment that
        strains their physical and emotional energies to the utmost limits,
        while offering beautiful descriptions and engaging comparisons between
        normal and ambisexual humans. The dry and straight to the point
        narration style that is prevalent throughout the book seems to best fit
        the story at this point and you can finally achieve an emotional
        connection with the characters.

      <p>
        The preface of the series is written by Neil Gaiman, a SciFi veteran
        author and someone who has quite some interesting thoughts which might
        explain my harsh criticism of <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em>. The
        single most important of his teachings is about the subject of SciFi: it
        is not the future, but the present. SciFi is only an extrapolation of
        the present times’ expectations, hopes and dreams for the future; a
        1950s future will tell much more about the 1950’s society than the
        actual future. And, in that regard, perhaps, we should be more indulgent
        when, 50 years later, we read about the past’s state-of-art simplistic
        ideas about gender.
