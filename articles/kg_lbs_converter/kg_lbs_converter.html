      <h1>3-Step Easy KG &#8644; LBS Converter</h1>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Everyone that had to talk to people from the US knows how annoying it is
        to have to convert their units to the <em>rest</em> of the world's. And,
        now, with the rapid growth of Crossfit, this issue will only get worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll leave aside my urge to yell "grow up and use the same, better units
        as everyone else"<foot-note
          text="The pound is nowadays actually defined using
        kilograms, and not any physical object anymore, which basically means
        that even the experts believe the kilogram to be a better measure. In
        sum, it is recognized as dumb mostly because it's not scalable at all."
        ></foot-note>
        at them and only focus at giving us an easier way of dealing with this
        problem. I'll also try my best to show a short algorithm or recipe for
        anyone to be able to convert their weights back and forth in their
        heads, without a calculator or a sheet of paper.

      <h2>2. The Recipes</h2>
      <p>
        The main requisite here, which is going to make the transformation
        accessible, is simple operations &mdash; for example, sums and
        subtractions are allowed, while multiplications and divisions are only
        permitted if they are done with easy enough numbers, i.e., those most
        people can handle, like doubling, tripling, halving, etc. &mdash;, and
        what's going to make things really easy is to focus on successive
        approximations, with these same simple operations. These successive
        approximations are very important for engineers, specially decades ago,
        enabling on the fly complex project estimates.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Believe it or not, but these successive approximations are what's
          actually used in human calculator competitions. So, if you practice
          them enough, you will be much faster than resorting to calculators or
          your smartphone. They are also a huge topic in mathematics, one big
          example being the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor Series</a
          >.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        If you want a quick approximation, use only the first 2 steps of the
        algorithms below.
      </blockquote>
      <h3>2.1 KG → LBS</h3>
      <p>
        Let's start with the rough conversion to have an idea of our final
        goal<foot-note
          text="Take the equal signs with a pinch of salt. The international
        standards vary from year to year sometimes, and it's a bit pointless to
        worry about being 100% precise, since we are not doing rocket science
        here."
        ></foot-note
        >:
      </p>
      <p>\[ 1 \ kg = 2.20462262185 \ lbs \approx 2.205 \ lbs \]</p>
      <p>
        For simplicity's sake, I'm gonna stick to using 2.205 as the conversion
        rate. Only if you're a strength freak and can lift weights of up to 500
        kg will the difference be relevant, and, even then, it would only amount
        to 0.0004 [latex] \cdot [/latex] 500 = 0.2 kg. If you're in that
        category and want precision, use the extra decimal places with the same
        flow shown in the following algorithm, but it might be better to just
        use a calculator anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to convert a weight measurement from <em>kg </em>to
        <em>lbs, </em>say 56 kg, we simply multiply the weight by the conversion
        rate:
      </p>
      <p>\[ 56 \ kg \cdot 2.205 = 123.48 \ lbs \]</p>
      <p>
        Which is probably not how a human would comfortably approach this
        problem. It's much easier to, for example, multiply the weight by 2 and
        then add 20% for an easy approximation. And it's in that spirit that you
        can derive something like:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Multiply the original weight by 2, and memorize it.
          <ul>
            <li>\( 56 \cdot 2 = 112 \ lbs \)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide the previous calculation by 10 and add to it.
          <ul>
            <li>
              \( 112 + 112 \cdot \frac{1}{10} = 112 + 11.2 = 123.2 \ lbs \)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          It's up to you if you wish more precision from now on. Usually, the
          steps above are enough to get a good idea of what the weight is. But,
          in any case, next, you could half the original weight, divide the
          result by 100 and, finally, add it to the previous calculation.
          <ul>
            <li>
              \( 123.2 + 56 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{100} = 123.2 + 28
              \cdot \frac{1}{100} = 123.2 + 0.28 = 123.48 \ lbs \)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To summarize our algorithm, let's use \( x_{kg} \) as our original
        weight in kilograms before conversion, \( x_{lbs} \) as our weight in
        pounds after the conversion and \( y \) as the intermediate values. The
        right arrow means that we should overwrite our previous value &mdash;
        of, say, \( y \) &mdash; with the calculation on the right.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>\( y \leftarrow 2 \cdot x_{kg} \)</li>
        <li>\( y \leftarrow y + y \cdot \frac{1}{10} \)</li>
        <li>
          \( x_{lbs} \leftarrow y + x_{kg} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{100}
          \)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>2.2 KG ← LBS</h3>
      <p>
        The counter part conversion can be found by simply "reversing" the
        previous one<foot-note text="&lt;em&gt;sup.&lt;/em&gt;"></foot-note>:
      </p>
      <p>
        \[ 1 \ lb = \frac{1 \ kg}{2.20462262185} = 0.4535923699997481 \ kg
        \approx 0.454 \ kg \]
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, I will not bother to use more than 3 decimal digits of precision.
        For huge weights of more than 200 kg, our imprecision will be around 200
        \( \cdot \) 0.00041 = 0.082 kg, not even 100 g. There's also the fact
        that, since we are multiplying by something smaller than 1, any mistakes
        or imprecisions we end up making will be seemingly minimized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's take the example of 225 lbs, which is the common substitute for
        100 kg:
      </p>
      <p>\[ 225 \ lb \cdot 0.454 = 102.15 \ kg \]</p>
      If we try to come up with the same answer but via approximations:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Halve the original weight.
          <ul>
            <li>\( 225 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 112.5 \ kg \)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Subtract 0.05 from the previous result, i.e., 10% of it:
          <ul>
            <li>
              \( 112.5 \ - \ 112.5 \cdot \frac{1}{10} = 112.5 \ - \ 11.25 =
              101.25 \ kg \)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          This should be precise enough for most use cases, but you could keep
          going. I would suggest adding a 0.005 factor instead of 0.004 (from
          the original 0.454), since it seems close enough and much easier
          (we're going to miss by 225 g), which means we should take 1% of step
          1's result and add it to step 2's. We will miss our mark by 0.1%, so,
          if you wish, add a step 4 where you subtract 1/1000 from the original
          weight in pounds.
          <ul>
            <li>
              \( 101.25 + 112.5 \cdot \frac{1}{100} = 101.25 + 1.125 = 102.375 \
              kg \)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To summarize this other algorithm, we take a similar notation to the
        previous converter with \( x_{lbs} \) as our original weight in pounds,
        \( x_{kg} \) as the result of the conversion in kilograms and \( y \)
        for intermediate results. Again, the right arrow means that we should
        overwrite our previous value &mdash; of, say, \( y \) &mdash; with the
        calculation on the right.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>\( y \leftarrow x_{lbs} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \)</li>
        <li>\( y \leftarrow y \ - \ y \cdot \frac{1}{10} \)</li>
        <li>\( x_{kg} \leftarrow y + y \cdot \frac{1}{100} \)</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Last Words</h2>
      <p>
        Will you use these algorithms? I think it depends more on you opening
        your own mindset and making a (small) effort of memorizing these recipes
        than whatever amazing magical methods I could come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, though, practically speaking, the biggest difficulty most
        people will have is probably trying to manage the numbers in their
        memory while having perform calculations in parallel. But it's not that
        much, I assure you. With a little bit of training and persistence, you
        can surely do it.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For both conversions, you will have to manage 3 numbers, the
          (intermediate) result, the original weight, and, sometimes, one of the
          results of a multiplication or division.
        </li>
        <li>
          For converting kg to lbs, you will have to perform 2 sums, 1
          multiplication and 3 divisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          For converting lbs to kg, you will have to perform 1 sum, 1
          subtraction and 3 divisions.
        </li>
