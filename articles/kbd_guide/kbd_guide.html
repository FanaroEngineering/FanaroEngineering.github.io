        <custom-h2 text="Introduction"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          This post was supposed to be one of the first on my site. I kept on
          postponing it because I simply couldn’t find the best keyboard. What
          changed my mind in the end is that I resigned from the saga of finding
          the best keyboard, it doesn’t exist yet &mdash; and I’m not talking
          about my taste. Nonetheless, there are many good ones, and discerning
          them from the bad or deceitful is not an easy task, something I’ve
          painfully learned from experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most people would say “whatever” to keyboards and just use the
          respective “whatever” plastic crap we receive as the standard in
          offices. While these generic devices are fine, you’re missing out on a
          much more pleasant experience if you ignore the quality side of the
          market. Besides that argument, keyboards are the main tool of today’s
          workers: just like a pianist would rather play on the best piano, I
          believe you wouldn’t want to type on crappy keyboards if you had the
          choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without further ado, let’s take a look at the major criteria for
          choosing a keyboard &mdash; believe me, if you don’t follow something
          similar to this ranking order, you will suffer: sound is not at all
          the most important factor &mdash; :
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Key Stroke Force</li>
          <li>Key Stroke Travel Distance</li>
          <li>Tactility or Abruptness</li>
          <li>Sound</li>
          <li>Keycap Quality</li>
          <li>Chassi Build</li>
          <li>Backlighting</li>
        </ol>

        <p>As some extra features I would include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Wireless</li>
          <li>Layout</li>
          <li>Customizability</li>
          <li>Keycap Shape</li>
        </ul>

        <p>

          further than

        <custom-h2 text="The Mechanical Keyboard Craze"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          Mechanical Keyboards are nothing new. The first commercial models came
          out in the late 1980’s and were just another option. Not even that
          actually. They were beaten to dust by IBM’s Model F and Model
          M<foot-note
            text="Model F and Model M stopped being manufactured mostly because 
            they were too expensive. Something that would cause laughter now 
            that mechanical keyboards can reach up to more than US$ 250."
          ></foot-note
          >, which used the now demonized rubber-domes (and buckling springs).
        </p>

        <p>
          So why is there such a big craze for mechanical keyboards nowadays?
          Mostly, after months of research and many keyboards of experience, I
          would say it’s at least 80% due to marketing. Since the 1990’s, the
          keyboard industry has had no differential to profit on, everything was
          made from cheap plastic and was mostly generic; now, with different
          mechanical switches, they’ve created not one but many different
          options &mdash; including ways of making yourself heard when typing
          from more than 30 meters (literally) &mdash;, something that certainly
          catches the eye of many consumers. Now, do these mechanical species
          really improve the user experience? Questionable.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is true, though, that there are some pros about the mechs. The huge
          amount of variations with respect to sound and key stroke force, for
          example, will probably make the user able to find its perfect match
          &mdash; albeit after an equivalently extensive research. All in all,
          mechs are valid products, just be mindful of their overhyped status.
        </p>

        <custom-h2 text="Major Features"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          You absolutely need to check for these features when buying a new
          keyboard: don’t be enthralled by their flashy lights and tattoos.
        </p>

        <custom-h3
          text="Key Stroke Force, Travel Distance and Tactility"
        ></custom-h3>

        <p>
          The graph below shows the key stroke force (grams)<foot-note
            text="Gram is actually not a force metric evidently. The respective 
            force would be the gram weight times the value of gravity."
          ></foot-note>
          necessary to make the keycap travel a certain distance (mm). From this
          graph, we can much more clearly understand the meaning of tactility in
          keyboard jargon. It has nothing to do with touch &mdash; that’s why I
          hate the term and would rather replace it with something like
          “abruptness” &mdash; but how abrupt is the transition that marks the
          key press. For example, one of the most iconic curves is the IBM
          Buckling Spring (dark green), which shows a linear beginning followed
          by a steep decline when the key press is identified: this is one of
          the most tactile, or abrupt, keyboards there is. In contrast, we can
          examine the Cherry MX Linear (blue) which has virtually no abruptness,
          a simple linear curve.
        </p>

          <img src="switch_graph.gif" alt="Switch Graph" />
          <figcaption>
            Key Stroke Force (grams) vs Travel Distance (mm) for Different Key
            Switches. The vertical climb at the end of all curves means that the
            keycap has reached the chassi and, thus, cannot be further pressed.
            45-60 g is the usual actuation force necessary to activate most
            switches.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Many preferences exist, however, most people would rather have tactile
          keyboards due to the physical feedback they give us, which not only is
          usually pleasant, but helps knowing if we are typing correctly or if
          the hardware is working well. This feedback is also probably why
          mechanical keyboards became so prominent with gamers: without it,
          gaming can be quite an unpleasant experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Selecting the best curve is the difficult part and will inevitably
          vary a lot individually. I can assure you it can become quite the
          rabbit hole, since no external opinion will guarantee a good
          experience. For me, personally, for example, a short travel distance
          with very low key stroke force is the best choice. Right now, I’m
          using a
          <a
            href="https://www.logitech.com/en-roeu/product/k780-multi-device-wireless-keyboard"
            >Logitech K780</a
          >
          which feels a lot like a laptop keyboard. Laptop keyboards are
          sometimes despised by the keyboard enthusiasts community who think the
          short key travel (&lt; 1.5 mm) is very unpleasant. I, on the other
          hand, have the opposite feeling; keyboards like the
          <a href="http://www.topre.co.jp/en/products/elec/keyboards/index.html"
            >Topre Realforce 45g</a
          ><foot-note
            text='Topre, originally Tokyo Press, is a Japanese brand that sells 
            electronics, among them the Topre switch, which has been called by 
            some a "glorified rubber-dome". The name "Realforce" comes from the 
            fact that the necessary force to press the switches is lighter on 
            the extremities of the keyboard, emulating the force difference 
            between the peripheric fingers and the centered ones.'
          ></foot-note>
          even started hurting my fingers due to the longer travel distances.
        </p>

        <p>
          My advice for those who want to look for better options is to first
          examine all of the characteristics of a keyboard you’ve already
          experienced, otherwise the search space will be overwhelming. Some
          manufacturers have started to offer numpad-like switch testers,
          however, they are mostly useless because the user will have no way of
          grasping the whole keyboard experience by pressing only one key, so
          beware of this new marketing trap. Also, on a sidenote, do not fall
          for the other marketing trap of believing Cherry MXs are the best
          switches ever, they are kind of generic and, in terms of quality, will
          never ever beat old school magnetic ones.

          Switches are the biggest part of the fun &mdash; and of the rabbit
          hole &mdash; when researching about mechanical keyboards. If you wish
          to continue researching on your own, some valuable initial extra
          resources are: the

        <custom-h3 text="Sound"> </custom-h3>

        <p>
          Please: don’t be an asshole. Unless you’re alone on an island, don’t
          buy Cherry MX Blue switches. Back in the 1980’s, when people were used
          to ultra noisy rooms full of frenzied typists, that would be ok. But
          now, in an office filled with people furiously thinking about more and
          more complex problems, why pollute the ambiance with a billion clicks?
          I wouldn’t even advise it for gaming, it’s annoying too &mdash; aren’t
          the visual and tactile feedbacks enough? &mdash; some lan houses feel
          like 20th century phone operator cabins filled with relays, which have
          been said to drive workers to insanity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nowadays, the hype for the Cherry MX Blues has diminished a bit, after
          their obvious side effects. But people still seem to not care much
          about the other human beings in the room. It is true that some of the
          muted keyboards have a mushy unpleasant<foot-note
            text="Obviously a relative opinion."
          ></foot-note>
          sound, but a middle ground can surely be found. Membrane keyboards
          usually are better, smoother, in this area, though they can get quite
          loud when typing very fast and with a lot of force &mdash; in keyboard
          jargon, bottoming-out. I believe one of the champions of sound quality
          and discreteness is for sure the Topre Realforce series, which,
          despite the mushy sound, is very pleasant and smooth. My only critique
          is with respect to the space bar &mdash; that’s actually a problem of
          99% of all keyboards &mdash; : it’s so wide that the sound gets much
          more higher pitched, sometimes disrupting the whole smooth experience
          of the other keys.
        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="Keycap Quality"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          You will not realize the importance of it until you experience better
          keycaps. Most commodity keyboards use ABS plastic keycaps, a cheap
          plastic material that gets greasy very easily and has a glossy look;
          while the quality side of the market tends to use PBT plastic keycaps,
          which has a mate look and a more rugged surface, something that also
          provides for an extra, pleasant, (literally now) tactile feedback.
          When I transitioned from a Razer Black Widow Stealth to a Topre
          Realforce 45g, keycaps were in fact my biggest surprise and not the
          key stroke feel, this alone was about 80% of the whole quality appeal
          the Realforce keyboard created in me. After my experience with PBTs,
          typing on my Macbook Air 2013 &mdash; which was either great or ok for
          5 years &mdash; feels incredibly cheap and crappy.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are also other variants of these two basic materials. For
          example, the Logitech K780 seems to use some sort of improved ABS
          which is not that bad, way better than my Macbook Air 2013. Great
          places to buy quality keycaps are

          customized keycaps<foot-note
            text="Check their compatibility with your switch first. 
            99% of them only fit into Cherry MXs."
          ></foot-note>

        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="Chassi Build"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          This was one of the major reasons I chose to get rid of my commodity
          keyboard. The biggest symptoms you should look for are: flex and
          weight of the chassi. Flexing is very common with cheaper boards;
          being made only from plastic, they will contract with pressure, and
          the location of the keys will move, which can be very annoying when
          typing. Lightweight chassis can also cause the same problem because,
          with each stroke, the user will inevitably push the keyboard somewhere
          else.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I recommend is to look for a chassi with a steel plate backbone
          &mdash; which is also used to protect the internal PCB. Having this
          plate can often solve both problems at the same time, since it reduces
          flexing and weighs a lot. In the end, 0.9-1.5 kg of weight is usually
          a good indicator that the manufacturer paid attention to this
          criterion.

        </figure>

        <custom-h3 text="Backlighting"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          In truth, I would say this should be in the Extra Features section,
          but, since so many people are now gamers, I’m giving it a little bit
          more importance. Most people, though, will buy backlit keyboards
          without even knowing why it’s a useful perk and not only a way of
          getting attention.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reason is that, when gaming, usually the room lights are off in
          order to improve the cinematic experience and, thus, if you want to
          know where a key is, you won’t be able to find it easily by looking at
          the keyboard. Backlighting, then, comes in handy, though one could
          argue that knowing how to touch type is probably more
          effective<foot-note
            text="Some games, like Starcraft, are actually very difficult even 
            for experienced touch typists. That’s because you’re gonna be 
            typing across the whole keyboard with only one hand. Hence, the 
            argument of better learning how to touch type becomes very weak."
          ></foot-note
          ><foot-note
            text="In the end, the question is: in the 21st century, is it that 
            hard or expensive for manufacturers to include backlighting in 
            every keyboard? Probably not, and it’s very shameful on you 
            manufacturers that you haven’t yet."
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, be careful when choosing a keyboard with backlighting, just
          because it exists doesn’t mean it is going to help. Take a look at the
          image below, do you see anything wrong? First of all, the letterings
          are not transparent, so what’s the point of backlighting? The user
          won’t be able to distinguish what the function of the key is in that
          case, and, besides that, we have a severe
          <em>backlight leakage</em> case here. When leakage happens, we see the
          light coming out from around the keycaps, which will create a more or
          less homogeneous light from the user’s point of view, making the
          backlight perk completely useless since it’s gonna be difficult to
          distinguish the letterings.

        <custom-h2 text="Extra Features"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          Unless it’s a matter of life and death, do not prioritize these
          features.
        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="Wireless"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          I think this is only very important when you need to carry the
          keyboard to many places<foot-note
            text="Or the computer is difficult to access physically."
          ></foot-note>
          &mdash; for instance, I bring my Logitech K780 everyday with me to my
          workplace. Otherwise, it’s mostly irrelevant because the keyboard
          won’t and shouldn’t move while you type anyway, in contrast with a
          mouse, for example.
        </p>

        <p>
          That said, I’m not here to condone manufacturers for not investing in
          wireless technology for keyboards. At this point, it’s incredibly
          shameful of them that the vast majority of all quality keyboards are
          not wireless, the technology necessary to achieve it has been created
          more than 20 years ago at least.

          For most people, this is actually very important, but I chose to put
          it in the extra features because, unless you prefer a foreign layout,
          it won’t be a problem, just stick to your country’s layout and it
          should be fine. In my case, I’ve used the Macbook Air 2013 ANSI layout
          so much that it’s difficult to type on the Brazilian ISO layout
          sometimes.

          That said, there are two main choices here: the ANSI and the ISO
          layouts. The biggest difference comes with the enter key and its
          peripherical punctuation keys. For coders, these differences can be
          quite annoying. Especially considering that each country has its own
          ISO variation<foot-note

          ></foot-note
          >. For most purposes, I think the ANSI layout is much better simply
          because it’s standardized &mdash; since the 1980’s with IBM &mdash;,
          but it’s a matter of personal preference and, much more importantly,
          habit.

          Nowadays, most manufacturers are paying more attention to this
          criterion, something that was widely disregarded 10 years ago. Many
          famous brands now have software to customize the layout and add new
          macros. However, you can always go deeper and program it for yourself
          from the ground up, though it is for sure another rabbit hole. If you
          want an example of ultimate keyboard programming experience, check out
          this “tutorial” from Linus Tech Tips’s channel.

          For simpler solutions, besides the proprietary software, there are
          some generic options: for windows,

        <custom-h3 text="Keycap Shape"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          In case you’ve never seen a picture of the Logitech K780, it has round
          keycaps. Quite frankly, it looks ugly, perhaps an abomination.
          However, it also resembles old mechanical typing machines. That’s
          purely a coincidence I believe, because the rounded keycaps were
          actually chosen due to research: the bigger spaces between the keys
          creates less room for typing mistakes: accuracy improves, on average,
          at least 20%. After using it for months I do agree with that assertion
          and also recommend this keycap shape.

          My summary of everything about the keyboard world, after having
          learned the basic technical stuff and plenty of minutia, is that it is
          all about personal preferences. The enthusiast community will try to
          push you a certain perception, the market, another and, yet, the
          individual will not be satisfied unless he breaks the chains and looks
          out for himself.

          Update on April 2021: I've been using the RealForce Topre 55g for
          about a semester, and I don't think I'm going back. Logitech's layout
          is extremely annoying on the F and arrow keys; and being dependent on
          software for handling your keyboard is very unnecessary, a marketing
          coup on the customer's independence. It's a very good keyboard
          overall, though.
