        The triple asterisks (***) are there to emphasize that this quote was
        probably <em>not</em> from Stalin<foot-note
          text='Did you know the word "Stalin" is derived from the word "stal", 
          which means "steel"? Here is a description from 
          &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin#Rise_to_the_Central_Committee_and_editorship_of_Pravda:_1912%E2%80%931917"&gt;
          Wikipedia&lt;/a>: &lt;em&gt;
          a name he had used since 1912. Derived from the Russian word for steel (stal), 
          this has been translated as "Man of Steel"; Stalin may have intended 
          it to imitate Lenin&apos;s pseudonym. Stalin retained the name for the 
          rest of his life, possibly because it was used on the article that established 
          his reputation among the Bolsheviks.&lt;em&gt;'

          >most Cold War, Soviet and Stalinist researchers seem to be of the
          opinion that this was <em>not</em> one of his quotes</a
        >
        &mdash; some of them didn't even know about the quote when first asked
        about it. The only >source that seems to confirm the quote's supposed
        origin is an unreliable memoir by one of Stalin's personal secretaries,
        Boris Bazhanov. Stalin's apex of power lasted from 1922 to 1952, and
        Bazhanov published his book in 1930 after having fled the Soviet Union
        in 1928, so he also didn't spend that much time with Stalin at the peak
        of his dictatorship. Anyway, here is what Stalin supposedly had said:
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        I regard it as completely unimportant who in the party will vote and
        how, but it is extremely important who will count the votes and how.
      </p>
      <p>
        The context was voting inside the Soviet party, which renders more
        credibility to the quote than would have been expected from those who
        claim that Stalin couldn't have said anything like it simply because
        there were no &mdash; important &mdash; public elections in the Soviet
        Union.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any rate,
        <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/stalin-vote-count-quote/"
          >there were probably many other famous thinkers who could have first
          spelled out this obvious-yet-disregarded truth</a
        >. One of the oldest ones is from Napoléon III (1808-1873), the nephew
        of Napoléon Bonaparte (1769-1821) and France's first president
        (1848-1852):

        Most people seem to acknowledge that counting is extremely important;
        however, when it comes to doing something about making it more
        transparent, the media, the experts, the politicians and the overall
        population all end up sweeping the problem under the rug. This attitude
        can get so hypocritical and frightening, that people can literally walk
        into public spaces and hack voting machines however they want in the
        USA, as shown by a
        <a href="https://youtu.be/svEuG_ekNT0"
          ><em>recent</em> episode of John Oliver's Last Week Tonight</a
        >. Some experts, fearing the scalability of hacks to electronic voting,
        even go as far as suggesting that we should go backwards, i.e. voting
        should be done manually, a method which has <em>supposedly</em> gone
        through many trials, and is very difficult and not scalable to
        hack<foot-note
          text="Which it absolutely isn't. Just watch John Oliver's episode to get some examples."
        ></foot-note>
        &mdash; e.g.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/w3_0x6oaDmI"
          >Tom Scott in this video for the Youtube channel Computerphile</a
        ><foot-note
          text="And, by the way, basically every hack Tom Scott mentions about
        electronic voting can be applied to manual voting. And the scalability
        argument doesn't hold because, if you hack at a level where many
        human-counted votes are being summed up, it's pretty easy to scale your
        attack. In the end, electronic voting can be hacked, and that's a bad
        thing, but what about the comparison to manual voting hackability? Where
        are the benchmarks? Where are the quantitative comparisons? Is
        electronic voting &lt;em&gt;really objectively worse &lt;/em&gt;than manual voting?"
        ></foot-note
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those arguments all miss the important point: transparency. Regardless
        of which voting system we choose, if we guarantee that the voter can
        check that her vote has been correctly counted, voting is, thus,
        hack-proof. If we can't guarantee transparency, we will never know if
        <em>any </em>of our elections' results were true<foot-note
          text="This would also
        eliminate the problem of the votes being counted correctly by many
        machines or humans, only to be transmitted in a biased manner by some
        higher ranked official."
        ></foot-note
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crucial problem is then: how to confirm that the votes were counted
        correctly while still keeping them secret? Well, in the past,
        <a
          href="http://fanaro.com.br/a-solution-to-frauds-in-digital-electoral-voting/"
          >I've posted about a very simple way of doing this using standard
          asymmetric cryptography</a
        ><foot-note
          text='The Portuguese version of that post can be found
        &lt;a
          href="http://fanaro.com.br/uma-solucao-para-fraudes-em-votos-digitais/"
          &gt;here&lt;/a
        &gt;.'
        ></foot-note
        ><foot-note
          text="In that system, not only do you confirm your vote, but you can
        also count all of the other anonymous, encrypted ones."
        ></foot-note
        >, which I later confirmed with two experts on the topic. To my surprise
        and disbelief, after asking them why, given its unbelievable
        transparency benefits, that was not being done anywhere, they all gave
        me laconic answers or discouraged me with infrastructure or logistical
        costs.
      </p>
      In the end, what I ask you is this:
      <em>what is the price you would put on knowing the truth?</em>

          Oh, and I almost forgot to mention: Stalin was once young also. And,
          apparently, far from bad. Who would have thought this guy would later
          end up killing millions of comrades? The image in this post's
