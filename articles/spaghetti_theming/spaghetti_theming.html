      <h1>Avoiding Spaghetti Theming | With an Example in Flutter</h1>

      <h2>1. What is Spaghetti Theming?</h2>

      <p>
        <em>Spaghetti Code</em> is when you have references and dependencies all
        over the place, in multiple "threads", making it difficult for the
        reader to know where things start or end. They were notorious when
        people overused
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto"><code>GOTO</code></a>
        statements &mdash; and the biggest cause for the extinction of that
        statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, what I'm calling <em>Spaghetti Theming</em> is the
        counterpart in UI, that is, when UI elements are jumbled throughout the
        code in multiple different files, with no clear end nor beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's very easy, if you're not disciplined and methodical, to have theme
        dependencies go awry in that fashion. For example, by having:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The same colors being repeated and referenced independently in
          separate files and classes, i.e., creating spaghetti threads.
        </li>
        <li>
          Themes in a module being partially tied to another one, i.e., tangling
          the spaghetti threads with no clear or systematic formula for creating
          the ties, and that's where things get messy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Coming to think about it, this problem seems pretty common, doesn't it?
        And it's not that easy to think of a trivial solution... so how do we
        avoid this mess? The short answer is <em>centralizing</em> all of the
        references, but the longer answer would take into account all of the
        different programming techniques we can use to achieve this
        centralization:
      </p>

      </ol>
      <h2>2. Using Classes and OOP to Organize your Theme Code</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most basic ways of avoiding this cross-referencing hell is to
        better organize your code and, if you're using Object-Oriented
        Programming (OOP), you can do so by putting the different elements of
        your theme in different classes. You will need to, then:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Extract all of the colors, shapes and sizes you use throughout the
          app.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create classes for each of these thematic abstractions. For example,
          you could create a class named <code>Colors</code>, which would,
          evidently, hold all of the apps colors &mdash; that's basically
          creating your app's color palette.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Depending on the language you're using, you could even use
              interfaces or abstract classes since most of these theme classes
              will be simple static constants repositories.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With respect specially to the colors, I have to add that you might have
        to be even more disciplined than usual. If you're not careful, it's even
        easier than normal to get them to appear all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take, as an example, the color white. Say you're using it as a
        background for many different types of containers and, every time,
        you're specifying something like <code>Colors.white</code
        ><foot-note
          text="&lt;code&gt;Colors&lt;/code&gt; is a built-in class in Flutter."
        ></foot-note
        >. Now, imagine you have to change this standard container background to
        dark blue, how would you do that easily?
      </p>
      <p>
        In that case, you should create a color class, probably for each widget,
        with a specific variable for that background. But I will go even
        further: what if &mdash; and this is not that uncommon &mdash; you want
        to change your global, standard white to, say, a white-grey after you
        have created color classes for many different widgets?
      </p>
      <p>
        Since you're always referencing the vanilla code for white in your
        separate widget color classes, you will have to change your white
        manually again for all of these different classes, etc. In this case,
        what you could do is create a variable that shields, abstracts the
        vanilla white, creating your own white in your own, custom color
        palette.
      </p>
      <p>I think it's going to be clearer with the code example below:</p>

      <pre>
        <code class="dart">abstract class AppPalette {
  static const Color white = Colors.white;
}

abstract class Container {
  static final Color background = AppPalette.white;
}</code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        This technique is very common in graphic design where we create custom
        palettes for our current design and reference every subsequent color to
        this palette and not the base, vanilla colors, and I can only see
        benefits if we use it programmatically in code.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more details on this topic, do check section 4 of this article for
        more concrete details on how to achieve what I suggested above.
      </p>

      <h2>3. DO: Avoid Hungarian Notation (HN)</h2>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation"
          >Hungarian Notation (HN)</a
        >
        occurs when you prefix or suffix a variable's name with information
        about its characteristics or type. For example, if you have a set of
        variables you would like the reader to know are constants, it was usual
        &mdash; many people still use this technique, since it's quite intuitive
        &mdash; to prefix them with the letter <code>k</code>. For example,
        <code>kLength</code> could be a length constant in your program.
      </p>
      That sounds like a great idea for encoding more semantics into the
      variables' names, right? Well...
      <p>
        HN was very useful in the past when types and classes didn't exist
        because it was basically the <em>only</em> way of encoding semantic
        information for the reader. One of its weaknesses, though, is that it
        isn't programmatically used, meaning that someone could just as well
        create a non-constant variable prefixed by <code>k</code> and nobody
        could easily, programmatically know if that would indeed be a constant
        or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if you put, say <code>kLength</code> into a class
        whose job is to store constants, everyone will know what you're talking
        about &mdash; indented text is also easier to read than text stitched
        together &mdash; and, if you put non-constants inside it, your
        language's analyzer or compiler itself can programmatically give you
        feedback, warning you that something is off.
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows, then, that, if you put <code>kLength</code> inside, say, a
        class named <code>Constants</code>, you will be redundant and make the
        code harder, more time-consuming to read. In the end, the most
        programmatic and easier-to-read way of accessing this constant would be
        &mdash; assuming it's a static constant &mdash;
        <code>Constants.length</code>.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Encoding the type of a function into the name (so-called Hungarian
          notation) is brain damaged &mdash; the compiler knows the types anyway
          and can check those, and it only confuses the programmer.<foot-note

      <h2>4. Centralizing your Theme with <code>ThemeData</code> in Flutter</h2>
      <p>
        Besides what I discussed in the second section of this article about
        placing different aspects of UI in different classes, in Flutter, you
        can leverage the power of an overarching theme for your app which will
        serve as the default styling for your widgets.
      </p>
      Some additional resources for this topic if you would like to know more:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A very nice tutorial &mdash; whose code I'm gonna be partially using
          below &mdash; can be found in the Flutter official documentation:
          <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/design/themes"
            >Use themes to share colors and font styles</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/stoJpMeS5aY"
            >Material Theming with Flutter</a
          >
          from Flutter Interact '19
          <ul>
            <li>
              There are also plenty of online <em>material</em> theming tools
              which can spit out design dimensions an palettes for you.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In Flutter, when configuring your <code>MaterialApp</code>, you can
        simply pass your custom theme through the <code>theme</code> property:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="dart">MaterialApp(
  title: title,
  theme: ThemeData(
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
    fontFamily: 'Georgia',
  ),
)</code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        As I discussed in section 2, you can also manage this
        <code>ThemeData</code> separately, in a <code>Theming</code> class for
        example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="dart">abstract class Theming {
  static final ThemeData app = ThemeData(
    iconTheme: defaultIcon,
  );

  static const IconThemeData icon = IconThemeData(
    color: BasicColors.grey,
  );
}</code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        Note that I'm not using a suffix for <code>icon</code>, which might seem
        weird at first, but, if you remember that everything in this class is of
        type <code>ThemeData</code>, it feels more intuitive. These properties
        will all be accessed as <code>Theming.someTheme</code> later on, so yet
        another reason for why this <em>will</em> be manageable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to override the theme for an individual widget, you can wrap
        it with the <code>Theme</code> widget and pass to this new widget your
        new custom <code>ThemeData</code>:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="dart">Theme(
  data: ThemeData(
    accentColor: Colors.yellow,
  ),
  child: FloatingActionButton(
    onPressed: () {},
    child: Icon(Icons.add),
  ),
)</code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        You can also override specific characteristics of the
        <code>context</code>'s or app's theme by using the
        <code>copyWith</code> method:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="dart">Theme(
  // Could also be `Theming.someTheme.copyWith(...)`:
  data: Theme.of(context).copyWith(accentColor: Colors.yellow),
  child: FloatingActionButton(
    onPressed: null,
    child: Icon(Icons.add),
  ),
);</code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        Theming shouldn't be much harder than that, i.e., having an overarching
        custom theme with some overrides here and there. Hence, if you're having
        trouble trying to manage your theme, you're probably doing something
        wrong.
      </p>

      <h2>
        5. Going Further: Managing Web and Mobile Themes with Media Queries
      </h2>
      <p>
        Managing multiple screen sizes can be time consuming and a maintenance
        nightmare, even with good practices. There is no panacea for this
        problem yet. However, Flutter uses a similar mechanism to the
        well-established practice of
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#Targeting_media_features"
          >CSS Media Queries</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inevitably, you're gonna have to change the layout of your screen
        depending on the width and height of your screen. And, for that, use the
        <code>switch</code> or <code>if-else</code> statements to return
        different sets of widgets to your screen. In order to extract the
        dimension over which you're basing the switch, you can use the
        <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQuery-class.html"
          ><code>MediaQuery</code></a
        >
        built-in class in conjunction with the <code>context</code>. For
        example, you can access the height, width and accessibility factor of
        the user's device through:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>MediaQuery.of(context).size.height</code></li>
        <li><code>MediaQuery.of(context).size.width</code></li>
        <li><code>MediaQuery.of(context).textScaleFactor</code></li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          If you wish to use <code>MediaQuery</code>(ies) optimally in Flutter
          for responsive designs, do try to use it in conjunction with the
          <code>LayoutBuilder</code> and <code>SafeArea</code> widgets. For more
          info, take a look at
          <a href="https://youtu.be/FQlZQGWJC58">this tutorial</a>, by Reso
          Coder.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        As an extra, if you feel too annoyed by the accessibility factor because
        it's really tough to create a design that's bullet-proof against any
        font-size, you can simply disable it by harding coding a factor
        yourself. For example:
      </p>

      <pre>
          <code class="dart">MaterialApp(
  builder: (BuildContext context, Widget child) {
    final MediaQueryData data = MediaQuery.of(context);
    return MediaQuery(
      data: data.copyWith(
        textScaleFactor: 1.0, // hard-coding the accessibility factor
      ),
      child: child,
    );
  },
);</code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        Hard-coding the accessibility factor isn't a UI/UX good practice, but
        it's understandable, at least during development.
      </p>

      <h2>5. On the Designer's Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        One of the sources of <em>Spaghetti Theming</em> has virtually nothing
        to do with code: design purely as art. Designers usually treat
        themselves as artists and that can burden the practicality of the
        project quite considerably if treated bluntly.
      </p>
      <p>
        This artist mentality originates from putting the design itself as the
        end product of the whole project, which is the brainwashing you
        inevitably get from schools. However, the project's end product is the
        the app, not only the design, which, thus, puts the design in a position
        of serving the rest of the project and not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>What do I mean by all that?</p>
      <p>
        The designer should produce a design that is art &mdash; no, we are not
        ditching that &mdash; constrained by the practicality of the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, it's very easy to want a confimation button on a screen to
        be blue and, on another screen, to be blue-grey, because you, as a
        designer, thought it prettier. The difference is minor but you, as an
        artist, will notice and cherish it. The difference is minor but the
        programmers, as implementers, will also notice it and, yet, hate it.
        Why? It's another variable for them to manage, another dependency with
        constant maintenance cost and very low benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you keep making these minor tweaks, do you see how the app won't have
        a scalable, manageable theme and design? It's your responsibility, as a
        pragmatic designer, to keep the design beautiful and, yet, as simple as
        possible to maintain: it's art, but it's not a painting you can hang on
        the wall, with virtually zero maintenance.
