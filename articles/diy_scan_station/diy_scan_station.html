      <h1>DIY Scan Station</h1>

      <p>
        With
        <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html"
          >Adobe Scan</a
        >
        now anyone can digitize books. I'm not saying you should
        <em>share</em> the resulting files online, I'm just saying you could
        make the experience more seamless with the rest of your digital tools,
        specially when it comes to taking notes.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're not using apps like
        <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> or
        <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, you don't know what you're
        missing out on. And, if you're using those types of apps with physical
        books, you might be thinking that somebody is trying to torture you for
        thinking too far ahead. The thing is: having the book and what you're
        using to take notes on different planes is the most important detriment
        to productivity in those cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        To help mitigate that problem, you could either go back to the stone age
        and take notes on physical hardware, like paper notebooks or the
        physical book itself, or you could have everything digitally. Once you
        do make the conscious, sane choice, I highly recommend using a better
        notetaking app for PDFs, like
        <a href="https://getpolarized.io/">Polar Bookshelf</a>. Polar offers a
        much easier way of tracking your progress, adding metadata, taking
        notes<foot-note
          text="That I actually do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommend. Use 
          Notion or Evernote instead, so you can centralize your notes."
        ></foot-note>
        and highlighting on top of the PDF itself. And the new release of Polar
        even adds a Dark Mode for PDFs, so you can optionally even read PDFs
        with a dark background, avoiding the white blinding void we typically
        get from PDFs on computer screens.

      <p>
        What will you need in order to achieve what I'm talking about with
        reasonable efficiency?
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>scanning device</strong> with access to the Adobe Scan app.
          It could simply be a smartphone or a tablet.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>platform</strong> for you to stabilize and fix the position
          of your scanning device. A transparent platform makes this even
          easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          A large enough <strong>sheet of glass</strong> so you can hold it
          without interfering with the scan. This will help you flatten the
          pages so your scanner can perform well. Otherwise the warping of the
          pages will completely ruin your scan. Scanning apps are not yet at the
          point where they can get past too much unevenness.
        </li>
      </ul>

          Use the glass sheet to flatten the page you're scanning and hold the
          rest of the book perpendicularly so the warping is minimized.

      <p>
        I've looked into a lot of scanning software to finally come up with this
        setup. This is the best I could do without buying an industrial book
        scanner. Besides this more pragmatic approach the closest I could get to
        something useful was the
        <a href="http://www.booksorber.com/">Book Sorber</a> app, which actually
        does offer an algorithm for dealing with warping as well as a bunch of
        other tools. However, my experience with these more sophisticated tools
        is that they get so complicated that, to the end user, the behavior
        becomes quite unpredictable. So you end up spending a lot of time trying
        to understand how to work with the tool, which is highly unproductive;
        and there's no way of knowing if invested time will pay off in the
        future.

        Please do add bookmarks/thumbnails to your PDF once you're done scanning
        and combining the files. You and everybody else will thank you a lot for
        the extra effort.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Adobe Scan is a much simpler app than Book Sorber, both in terms of
        algorithms and UI/UX. And it also probably features the state of the art
        in terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR not only makes the
        PDF lighter &mdash; because things are then encoded into text and not
        images &mdash; but it also makes it possible for the user to copy-paste
        text digitally, which will surely save you a lot of time when studying
        its contents. And if you're integrated with the rest of Adobe's Creative
        Cloud, you'll likely have other optimization perks on Adobe Acrobat PDF,
        such as combining and compressing PDFs. This is not an advertisement for
        Adobe, I think the current state of the PDF industry is quite sad and
        due to Adobe's predatory practices, but the reality is that they are
        offering the best deal overall.
