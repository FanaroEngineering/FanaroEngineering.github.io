      <h1>Search Engine Index</h1>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Motivation"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          Everyone knows Google's value. Even though they were not the first
          search engine, they certainly made it <em>the tool</em> of the last
          decades. Sites like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc look like search engines
          and act as such, but there are other sites in which we constantly
          search and use as search engines &mdash; YouTube and Wikipedia are 2
          simple examples &mdash; despite them not being fully categorized in
          the search area. This article is mostly dedicated to being a
          compendium of these tools so that you may come back whenever you wish
          to experiment with something new or improve your setup.

          Did I miss an important search engine in the table below? If so,
          please do email me at:

        <blockquote>
          Let me know if it would be worthwhile to create a true, programmatic
          database for the table below &mdash; it just kept on growing and
          growing...
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The tables below feature all of the relevant search engines I could
          find or remember, even those that are kind of known to anyone living
          on this planet, it's important to list them all, in my opinion.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've also tried to categorize the SEs in the subsections below, but
          many of them could be used for other tasks, of course.

        <blockquote>
          My complete qutebrowser configurations are
          <a
            href="https://github.com/psygo/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/qutebrowser/config.py"
            >here</a

          to it.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          In qutebrowser, you have 2 options to manage your configurations:
          <code>autoconfig.yml</code> and <code>config.py</code>. The YAML file
          is much easier to read, but much more limited, and you won't have
          access to any logical operations, since you're not really using a
          programming language to configure your browser.
          <code>autoconfig.yml</code> will get you going at first, but I
          recommend you translate your configurations as soon as possible into
          its Python counterpart, isolate and centralize things thence, it's
          gonna be a much simpler and cleaner setup &mdash; add this line to the
          top of your <code>config.py</code>:
          <code>config.load_autoconfig(False)</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you're done with the translation, you're able to mess around with
          your search engine shortcuts. For example, when opening a new page,
          you can use
          <code>:open &lt;search-engine-shortcut&gt; &lt;search-query&gt;</code
          >. I typically prefix my search engine shortcuts with
          <code>:</code> so they don't collide with common words or other
          commands, but you can use whatever you want. Don't forget to use
          <code>{}</code> as a placeholder for your search queries. Most
          websites use <code>/search?q=</code> as a URL code for search queries,
          but you will have to test in each one before being sure, this is not
          standardized anywhere, it's the website's choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Brave, as most other Chromium-based browsers, also features this same
          search engine shortcuts possibility. To tweak it, go to
          <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Manage search engines</code>.
          Surprisingly, I think the GUI layout they chose for this part of the
          settings obfuscates the feature they are trying to convey, it took me
          a long while to realize what that part of the settings was about.
          Hopefully, what I explained above for qutebrowser will help you
          navigate it better.
