        <custom-h2 text="Introduction"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          After 24 hours inside airplanes, more than 10 hours waiting on
          airports, 2 connections, and 2 more hours in a bus, I finally arrive
          at the hotel. To enter the building, I pass through the outward doors
          with my hefty luggage, but, as I go through the second, an
          ill-calibrated timer closes it on me, making me stuck at the entrance
          of the main hall: while a paralyzed hostess watches the scene
          struggling to come up with a solution, I have a strange premonition
          that this whole situation will be a metaphor of my incoming stay in
          the country.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Why did I go there?"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          For those who don’t know my background &mdash; for those who do,
          please bear with me this n-th repetition of the same story &mdash;,
          throughout university, during my bachelors degree in engineering, I
          saw my interest in the field wane: the jumbled world of abstractions
          presented by the professors seemed only to needlessly complicate a
          world that was much simpler in the daily practice. As a result, I
          couldn’t help but erroneously generalize the feeling of emptiness to
          life itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          I could even argue that this hole, the death or coma of interest, was
          the main reason why I decided to take part in an exchange program in
          Europe one year and a half earlier. Consciously, I deeply wanted my
          love for science to rekindle during my stay in the old continent,
          however, subconsciously, my general interest for life was at stake.
        </p>

        <p>
          That somewhat brief one year period revolutionized my life.
          Unexpectedly, Go &mdash; Baduk or Weiqi &mdash;, a hobby I learned in
          my second year at university, brought me a family which taught me the
          real value of friendship, a new language &mdash; French &mdash; and a
          lifelong set of lessons I’m still learning from.
        </p>

        <p>
          Coming back to my last semester in my original university I soon
          realized the diagnosis of my lack of interest was worse than before
          with respect to my courses. Only Go would shine in my mind<foot-note
            text="My conclusion here should be taken suspiciously. The more I 
            think about the subject, the more I believe that the set of people 
            I met in Belgium made the difference, not so much the game of Go. 
            Had I played with impolite pricks there, my destiny would have 
            hardly been the same."
          ></foot-note
          >. It was amidst this shift in interest and doubts about my future
          that I decided to take my chances and follow my then passion, moving
          to Asia, the birthplace of my beloved sport.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="My Choice for the Main Path"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          Obviously worried about my future, I didn’t want to land on the other
          side of the globe without a plan. The first choice that comes to mind
          is to go for the intense monk-like training inseis tend to have.
          However, this did not seem to be a good prospect, as I would most
          likely not become as strong<foot-note
            text="I started playing Go at the age of 21 in 2011. I hit 14k 
            after teaching myself with an app within 3 months; and, after 6 
            months of knowing the game and some videos on YouTube, I was a 9k. 
            Within a year I had reached 3k and the journey became much more 
            nonlinear and full of gaps where I simply wouldn’t play. Nowadays, 
            I’m content with my 1d level. All in all, I’ve had a relatively 
            fast learning curve, but not at all sufficient to have hopes for 
            competitive differential."
          ></foot-note>
          as the vast majority of the students, nor would it help that much
          financially or fulfill my intellectual needs, as I believe life is
          bigger than Go. My idea, an attempt at achieving better balance, was,
          then, to mix academic studies in parallel with improvement in the
          game.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the time all this internal storm was raging, my interest for the
          exact sciences was, as previously mentioned, essentially dead. With
          the puzzling effect of my experience in Europe, I couldn’t help but
          gradually dive into the mysteries of social interactions. Eventually,
          the question I was internally urged to solve became more clear: with
          respect to Go &mdash; and, more generally, board games &mdash; what
          would be the set of good behaviors and attitudes which would most
          likely yield a good social interaction? Hopefully, answering that
          enigma would make me and many others able to better control the
          environment of a Go Club, letting the game be more enjoyable and the
          related emotions less of an issue.
        </p>

        <p>
          That question is mostly a subject of the not so well known &mdash;
          much to the shame of academics &mdash; field of microsociology, the
          middle child of the sociology and psychology brothers. This field
          studies interactions within groups of individuals and is sometimes
          considered a black sheep due to the fact that you can’t use reliable
          statistics like you do in sociology &mdash; since the population is
          too small &mdash; and neither can you blindly generalize the extensive
          body of work psychology has created for the behavior of individuals.
          Nevertheless, there are some important concepts which have been safely
          confirmed; and, probably, the most relevant to the aforementioned
          question is the <em>Shame Loop</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <em>Shame Loop</em> has been a recurrent topic for psychologists
          and nothing really new, however it does not only have an effect on the
          individual but, also, on the interaction. In simple terms, whenever
          someone becomes a victim of shame, he or she tends to lower
          self-esteem, to the point of causing more shame and, thus, creating a
          destructive spiral. But, in a less expected manner, this spiral also
          acts on the interaction between individuals, because it is observed
          that when one of the actors demonstrates that he or she is ashamed,
          the other person will most likely also feel ashamed for making the
          other ashamed, and so on, shaping another spiral. This phenomenon can
          be seen in various social occasions, and I would argue that it’s very
          frequent in Go: rarely will you see players who take losing healthily;
          and no wonder the more emotionally stable players are usually the
          stronger ones<foot-note
            text='Interestingly, we seem to ignore the fact that, during a Go 
            game, when attempting to kill a group, we feel the same emotions 
            and biological signals a cold-blooded killer would have while 
            ending one of his victims’ lives. In &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NNnIGh9g6fA"&gt;one of his amazing lectures&lt;/a&gt; 
            (at minute 37), Robert Sapolsky, a Stanford professor, discusses 
            this theme, among others &mdash; personally, I really enjoy his 
            lecture on Depression.'
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          The basic advice psychologists would give you to dispell the
          <em>Shame Loop</em> is to be conscious about the phenomenon &mdash;
          acknowledging it helps it to not be transformed into general anger or
          indifference &mdash; and to be surrounded by loving people who can
          help you overcome it. But Thomas J. Scheff, in his

          history’s biggest geniuses &mdash; such as Nietzsche and Wagner
          &mdash;, is just as an important technique. In spite of the valuable
          insights for individuals, as far as my &mdash; small &mdash; 30 book
          initial researcher could tell me at the time, there was very little
          work, or at least it was well hidden, on how to avoid socially &mdash;
          that is, through social behavior and attitudes &mdash; the Shame Loop,
          and that’s exactly what I wanted to tackle.

        <custom-h2 text="Myongji University"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          After settling for the mix of academic research and Go training, I
          spent some time trying to find a suitable institution which would help
          me achieve my goals. It was mostly difficult to find any, since my
          requisites were very specific and the language barrier was enormous –
          I only had some rudiments of Chinese. Eventually, I converged to
          basically the only institution that had a seemingly reasonable fit:
          Myongji University, more specifically the
          <a href="http://www.mjubadukstudies.com/en/"
            >Department of Baduk Studies</a
          >. This school was founded by Professor Jeong Suhyeon (정 수혀), a
          psychologist and Korean 9p, credentials which, at least at a
          superficial level, helped assure me the department had some rigor.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, once in South Korea &mdash; and also before arriving there
          &mdash;, I started to realize that some things were off.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most flagrant one was the fact that there were very few Westerners
          in the Department. Despite so many ardent Go lovers in the West, only
          a handful of them were there and none in my year &mdash; I had only
          one colleague in my year of the Master’s program, a young Chinese
          economist. Although the Department incentivized &mdash; mostly with
          full scholarships &mdash; foreigners to come and study there, after 20
          years of existence, most of them wouldn’t take the offer. And the
          reason comes from two factors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Firstly, the school was created to satiate a need: as Go grew in
          popularity in South Korea, more and more people would like to take it
          as profession, but, having no credentials and no other skills besides
          playing, a lot of people would end up unemployed, and a lot of
          professionals, with insufficient income. The Department of Baduk
          Studies gave these individuals sufficient technical means for teaching
          Go and credentials which would enable them to be valued by society,
          surely an accomplishment worthy of praise. This whole environment,
          however, was never intended to those who sought different goals and,
          thus, Westerners would invariably be disappointed.
        </p>

        <p>
          In second place as an issue, I would rank the academic deficit. I do
          not recall, in my one semester stay, having heard of any paper or
          research that came out of this Department as being relevant to any
          other fields, though, again, 20 years have gone by. And it is not as
          if their field were anything new, it is just an application of much
          wider areas of knowledge, such as psychology, history and game theory.
          In my opinion, this school lacks a strong academic leadership, which
          could be achieved through catering Go loving researchers, who are, in
          fact, sufficiently numerous for that purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another problem that deeply disappointed me is the inexistence of a
          systematic method of improving the strength of the students. Due to
          many, if not most, of the students already being professionals or very
          high ranked amateurs, I believe the professors saw no gain in having
          some kind of league or training to improve the students’ strength;
          but, to the international ones, it feels like staying for years in the
          Shaolin Temple and being able to, at best, only watch the monks train.
          Of course, the underlying work to manage such a system would be too
          much for the professors alone, but they could, for example, much like
          in monasteries, make it mandatory for stronger students to help weaker
          ones or just outright hire Go teachers: after all, having a Department
          of Baduk Studies which does not directly include studying the game
          feels wrong at a core level<foot-note
            text="As a sidenote, I must mention that the professors would 
            offer commentary in various classes. But they were almost never 
            intended as training but as practical applications of the subjects 
            taught in the specific class."
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, my critique of the school is negative, but I must stress the
          fact that the people I met there were very kind and welcoming. The
          professors, for instance, mostly helped me whenever possible and even
          tried to convince me to stay when I decided to quit the Master’s
          degree. And, probably, the biggest benefit of being part of the
          program is the independence they will give you, specially if you can
          do the work by yourself. If you wish to know more about it, feel free
          to message me through Facebook or get in touch with Prof. Daniela
          Trinks, who is the main point of contact for Westerners in the
          Department.

        <custom-h2 text="The Language"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          By far this was my biggest underestimation in years. From gleaning
          through Korean textbooks, after learning the alphabet, you will
          probably have the impression that this is an easy language, or, at the
          very least, the easiest among the Asian ones. Wrong<foot-note
            text='In recent studies, the Foreign Service Institute of the USA, 
            after years of research, has come up with a scale about the 
            difficulty of each language, given that the learner is an English 
            speaker. &lt;a href="https://langfocus.com/language-features/what-is-the-easiest-language-to-learn-for-english-speakers/"&gt;At the highest level&lt;/a&gt;, 
            with a minimum requirement of 2,200 hours of study, is Korean, 
            along with Chinese, Cantonese, Japanese and Arabic.'
          ></foot-note
          >. After learning some words and having fun with how modular the
          language is, you will finally &mdash; make no mistake, this
          realization takes time; to me, it took more or less 3 months &mdash;
          realize that the crux of Korean is: context.
        </p>

        <p>
          What King Sejong (세종), the historical father of modern Korean, did
          was, at its surface, marvellous, a beautiful simplification.
          Nonetheless, the Chinese background still remains, which makes things
          very unexpectedly confusing to learn. King Sejong replaced the Chinese
          ideograms for an alphabet, which makes writing much simpler, since you
          don’t need to memorize thousands of symbols anymore, however, this
          also brings a lot of other sources of mistakes, because, now, all the
          inherent Chinese homophones have also become homographs, thus having
          essentially no way of differentiating themselves. In other words, you
          will end up with a lot of words that, for different contexts, will
          have completely different meanings &mdash; this also greatly
          diminishes the value of dictionaries, since definitions cannot be very
          concise anymore. Homographs and homophones are normal for basically
          every language, but the sheer scale they take in Korean is just
          appalling, frightening, for any beginner, who will be second guessing
          every phrase he or she hears or, even, reads.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, when I mention my massive underestimation, I’m actually
          referring to my approach of learning the language. My plan was to
          learn it on the go and only when I needed to, after all, my main
          interests were Go and psychology, not Korean. This is very unlike my
          general attitude towards languages, which is generally of considerable
          interest; but, in the case of Korean, I couldn’t help but feel
          hopeless once I realized that the vast majority of the resources I
          could use as a beginner came from pop culture, an area mostly lacking
          in content quality. As a result, the more I tried to learn Korean, the
          more I wished I had stuck to Chinese instead, with their bigger,
          longer, stronger cultural heritage.
        </p>

        <p>
          In sum, it is clear that learning Korean &mdash; or any language,
          really &mdash; the way I tried to is a recipe of failure. Instead, it
          would have been much more effective to follow the path many Westerners
          and some other Asian foreigners took &mdash; and that only much later
          I discovered I was eligible to &mdash;: take a semester or a year of
          sole dedication to the language, in a program most South Korean
          Universities offer, with steep discounts for their graduate students.
          I don’t know if I would have gone to South Korea if such a program
          were mandatory, but it was at least a worthwhile consideration.

        <p>
          It is true that I haven’t traveled that much in South Korea &mdash;
          nor have I spent that much time there &mdash;, so this won’t be an as
          comprehensive a guide as I would like it to be. Nevertheless, I’ve had
          enough experience in some of the more important environments, that is,
          those most people will likely spend the majority of their time
          in<foot-note

          Korea has become the embodiment of all of the capitalist principles, a
          country that works: which does not necessarily mean
          fulfillment<foot-note
            text="Of course, that’s also debatable."
          ></foot-note
          >. What I saw is a people that live to work and not work to live, a
          different philosophy than mine which, in my opinion, seeks to
          transform each individual into literally a mere cog within the system.
          The general atmosphere seems to subconsciously force, with unbearable
          power, each person to work, in spite of the activity being more often
          than not a menial and meaningless job: to work seems to be the meaning
          of life. Though this ideology might make the population happy, it is
          nonetheless a big source of alienation.
        </p>

        <p>
          One curious side effect of it is related to the book shop density in
          the big cities. I was very surprised to almost not find a book shop in
          the medium sized town I was living in &mdash; Yongin (용인) &mdash;,
          and how sparse book shops in Seoul (서울) are &mdash; you may have to
          Google for them in order to find one. In comparison with Western large
          developed cities, where you can find a book store within some blocks
          or, at least, in every shopping mall, I was a bit baffled by Korea.
          Besides the internet, the only explanation I could arrive at is that
          their education, though high in many standards, is mostly utilitarian
          and competitively oppressive, a perspective which does not usually
          incentivizes the reader to keep on learning.

          n the end, the final form of capitalism seems to be a Korean
          marketplace &mdash; with many offices on top &mdash;, where people
          both work and buy, all in one place, and where people can also have a
          break from their tiresome schedules by playing bowling with their work
          colleagues or having overnight Starcraft sessions, or, perhaps when
          feeling too much stress, release their anger violently, inside a bat
          cage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Obviously, this is just my opinion, which I mostly focused on the
          aspects that affect the majority of the population, and which I found
          most memorable and wicked. Though South Korea has a lot of facets I
          believe are just flat out wrong or bad for human existence, I must
          make a concession to state that their people are overall some of most
          compassionate I’ve ever met. Despite the occasional feeling of being a
          zoo attraction of the Western subspecies, spending time with them is
          mostly very pleasant.

          After my final decision of quitting Myongji was made, I still had
          about 45 days before my flight back home. Although I could move it
          forward I chose to stay and try out a more intense training
          experience. Since I already had some friendship with the people at
          BIBA<foot-note
            text="Blackie’s International Baduk Academy, managed by Kim 
            Seungjun 9p (김 승준 or Blackie) and Diana Koszegi 1p, is the only 
            English speaking Go school in South Korea."
          ></foot-note

          of a plan B I had before going to South Korea, in case the attempt
          with Myongji failed.
        </p>

        <p>
          My initial idea was to stay more than 45 days if I liked the
          experience, however, eventually, money also took its toll in
          convincing me to go back at the previously scheduled date. BIBA has
          its pros and cons<foot-note
            text="A complete review of my experience at BIBA is a topic for 
            another post. Nonetheless, two of the main issues are: it is 
            expensive and the training schedule is not that rigorous &mdash; 
            which could be good or bad, depending on the player. I believe 
            they arrived at a more flexible schedule simply because it’s 
            difficult to fit people from very different countries and ages 
            into a single strict program."
          ></foot-note
          >, and they’ve had to go through a lot of changes in the last years,
          since the amount of international students has been steadily
          diminishing &mdash; I guess the hardcore players are now content with
          the internet and the scattered professionals now in the West &mdash;,
          but the quality of the commentary given by Blackie and the other
          teachers will not be any less than amazing. I was shocked at how far
          from what I expected Blackie’s level is &mdash; I was just completely
          hopeless at a 5 stones handicap &mdash;, his intuition and open mind
          are traits which impress all who meet him, besides his loving and
          joyful personality.

        <p>
          I’ve learned a lot from the teachers there, specially when it comes to
          training &mdash; Diana’s unbelievable persistence at teaching me how
          to solve tsumegos… &mdash; and another much more pragmatic approach to
          Go. The last days in the school were tough on my completely exhausted
          self, I had doubts all over the place about my future and felt an
          utmost disappointment at how big a failure this attempt of a new life
          based on Go on the other side of the planet was, but, at least, BIBA
          gave me a sensation of closure, a more open mind, and taught me the
          value of repetition &mdash; not to mention the necessary wisdom to
          arrive at the meaning of life<foot-note

          For a long time I’ve been trying to learn from my stay in South Korea
          &mdash; about one year now &mdash;, and I’ve come up with a
          miscellanea of explanations for why it didn’t work out and why I
          eventually decided to quit. In a concise summary: it wasn’t worth it
          &mdash; which is a totally subjective statement.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my stay, I saw students, friends and professionals put an
          ungodly amount of work into Go only to be recognized as marginally
          valuable by others and, in doing so, they would invariably have to let
          go of other pursuits for knowledge, either due to a lack of time or a
          lack of energy, something my personality absolutely cannot stand, as I
          view specialization as a consequence and not a primary objective
          &mdash; which is a bad perspective for life nowadays, since capitalism
          basically only values specialized intellect.
        </p>

        <p>
          In parallel, I saw myself fully committed in a Master’s program I
          found more and more questionable both in terms of helping me achieve
          my desired goals as a researcher and in terms of financial prospects,
          while having to bash my head against the Korean language everyday and
          face the naturally subtle ostracization of Korean society. Ultimately,
          my passion for Go did not cut it &mdash; in fact, it remains in a coma
          to this day, mainly only creating online educational content for
          beginners.

          At the very end, in one of my last days, as I ate with the other BIBA
          students while being filmed by a TV crew of a documentary on
          international Go players in South Korea, I became paralyzed by fear
          and sadness, remembering the infinite set of doors I had got stuck in,
          when they asked: what will you miss about Korea?

            slightly questionable exaggeration, his best friend – this is not
            the moment I talk about in the last paragraph of the text.
