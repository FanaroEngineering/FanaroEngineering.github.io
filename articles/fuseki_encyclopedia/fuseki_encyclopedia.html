      <h1>The Pocket Fuseki Encyclopedia</h1>

      <p>
        Here are two files that basically summarize everything I know about the
        opening or fuseki. I’ve tried to keep it short, but, you know, it’s Go
        we are talking about. This is the content I wish I had access to when I
        was a beginner, so I hope you will like it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m a 1d KGS player who has been to a lot of places and talked to a lot
        of people across the globe, including South Korea and China, so this is
        not a professional speaking, but I’m sure even some 3d KGS players don’t
        know some sequences I’ve cited in the files.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first file of the pair is about the basics, it’s meant to be read by
        anyone ranging from 20k to 5k, but, again, most players up to 1d will
        get something out of it. The second one is actually the most valuable
        asset, it’s meant to be an extensive exploration of everything I know,
        ranging from the new 3-3 developments to the annals of fuseki, featuring
        the many Chinese opening fusekis, dual facing 3-4s, the
        <a href="https://rfg.jeudego.org/index.php/item/135-fuseki-trou-noir"
          >Black Hole</a
        >
        fuseki, and many more.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve written this content with Sabaki and would advise the reader to use
        it when studying the variations<foot-note
          text="You can customize Sabaki to a large extent by following the 
          instructions here. It’s somewhat convoluted, but it works."
        ></foot-note>
        as, from my experience, some editors seem to read the SGF standard
        wrongly &mdash; including CGoban in some cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        To ease your way through the massive number of variations I’ve also
        included a mind map that summarizes all of the branches &mdash; using
        the free <a href="https://www.xmind.net/">XMind</a> software. I wish
        there were a direct way of linking the branches from the SGF tree to a
        mind map just so large SGF files were easier to read, but so far that
        doesn’t exist.
        <a href="https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki/issues/488#node-sldfk"
          >I’ve suggested it to the creator of Sabaki</a
        >
        on Github and he seems to have been working on a similar idea and
        perhaps an implementation of this &mdash; breakthrough &mdash; idea is
        not far off.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make everything more digestible, I’ve broken the content into smaller
        bites: 4-4, 3-4 and the rest.

          ></local-link></strong
        >. I wanted to post the files interactively here, but WordPress seems to
        have been denying me the upload of SGF files lately. Anyway, I hope you
        enjoy my pocket fuseki bible.

        Later, if you wish to continue your studies, I would highly suggest you
        take a look at
        <a href="http://ps.waltheri.net/">Waltheri’s Go Pattern Search</a>,
        which will give you a database look at what professionals prefer. Other
        resources like the
        <a href="http://www.josekipedia.com/">Josekipedia</a> or
        <a href="http://eidogo.com/">Eidogo</a> are also very useful.
