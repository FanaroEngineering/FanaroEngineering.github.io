        <custom-h2 text="About the Datasets"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          These datasets come from
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a> and have been
          upvoted quite consistently by the community. The
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps"
            >Apps Dataset</a
          >
          comes from web scraping the Google Play Store on 10,000 apps and
          64,000 reviews &mdash; though it seems to have some repeated lines on
          it, which effectively makes it a 8,900 apps dataset. And the
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/home"
            >Wines Dataset</a
          >
          comes from web scraping the
          <a href="https://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine"
            >WineEnthusiast</a
          >
          website &mdash; and it also suffers from repeated lines: it goes from
          150,000 to 90,000 reviews. All this data offers invaluable insights
          about the app and wine markets, some of which we will discuss here.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to study these datasets, I’ve taken the time of refreshing my
          Statistics background with an incredible Udemy course by Jose Portilla
          &mdash; he manages to create a very simple, practical and easy to
          learn approach to the subject &mdash;:
          <a
            href="https://www.udemy.com/probability-and-statistics-for-business-and-data-science/"
            >Probability and Statistics for Business and Data Science</a
          >. The statistical tests discussed in the second half of the course
          will be useful to attest our findings. I’ve also made my course notes
          and a mind map available, along with my Python code, in
          <a href="https://github.com/psygo/Statistics">this Github Repo</a>.

          <figcaption>
            Right off the bat, we can see that, for different prices, we can get
            very different ratings, meaning that price might not be very
            correlated with quality.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          First, let’s take a look at the general characteristics of the data.
          From the graphs below, histograms that show the percentage of apps for
          each range of rating, we can clearly see that the majority of the apps
          stand within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 (a little bit more than 50%), and
          the apps that manage to get really good scores represent at best 7% of
          the market.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="google_hist_prices.jpg" alt="" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          Now, when it comes to prices, this dataset is &mdash; as is reality
          &mdash; heavily skewed towards free apps, since they represent most of
          the Google Play Store<foot-note
            text="Or, at least, the one depicted in the dataset."
          ></foot-note
          >. Effectively, only 7% &mdash; coincidentally, but totally
          uncorrelated, the same percentage of apps that happen to get the
          highest scores &mdash; that of the apps are paid, and that’s why the
          statistical tests briefly mentioned at the beginning of the post will
          come in handy.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, first, let’s take a look at the means and standard
          deviations<foot-note
            text="For those who don’t know what standard deviation is: 
            essentially, it is a measurement of how far the data is from the 
            average, i.e., a measurement of dispersion."
          ></foot-note>
          of the ratings and the prices. Although, the vast majority of the
          prices are zero, the mean is slightly off, reaching $0.97, with a very
          high standard deviation of 16.2. This is due to the fact that there
          are some apps at very high prices, like $399 for the app
          <em>I Am Rich Pro</em> &mdash; which offers no content and is actually
          (obviously) a joke<foot-note
            text="Its reviews are quite hilarious."
          ></foot-note
          >. As for the ratings, their mean is at 4.18 and, if you were to
          consider them as normally distributed as an approximation<foot-note
            text="Most phenomena in life are normally distributed, like 
            height, weight, flips of coins, etc."
          ></foot-note
          >, 66% of them would range from 3.66 to 4.70, a standard deviation of
          approximately 0.52. This rating mean will be useful for us later, when
          we assess the difference between free and paid apps.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, after some lines of code to divide our data into the two
          categories, we finally arrive at the difference in quality between
          paid and free apps. The mean and standard deviations (std) for the
          free apps remain intact (4.18 and 0.52, respectively), since they were
          the overwhelming majority in the data. On the other hand, indeed, the
          paid apps offer us an improvement, with a mean of 4.26, though with an
          std of 0.56. But the question now is: is this difference due to
          oscillations in the data or is it truly the reality?
        </p>

        <p>
          To answer that question, we can use a statistical test, which would
          try to discern the statistical differences between the two samples, a
          not so trivial task, specially because the size of the groups is very
          different. I’ve coded two tests which both work in this case: the
          Student’s t-Test and the ANOVA Test. ANOVA will try to discern the
          variance between groups (useful information) from the variance within
          groups (useless information or noise), while the Student’s t-Test will
          use the ratio between the difference of the means and the samples
          variabilities. In the end, you will compare your coefficient to
          another, theoretically calculated, that will give you, within a
          percentage of confidence, their likelihood of being similar. In our
          case, for the ANOVA test, we get that, with 99% confidence, our
          results do hold true (our F = 12.88 > 6.63 = the critical F
          coefficient) – a similar difference can be obtained for the Student’s
          t-Test, with our t = 3.38 > 2.33 = the critical t
          coefficient<foot-note
            text="Summarizing everything in a paragraph feels like a 
            disrespect to my brain…"
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          So… indeed, with at least 99% confidence, paid apps are better than
          free apps. But should you care? Again, the difference is minuscule,
          less than 0.1 in a scale of 0 to 5, with a much bigger variability
          than the difference itself. Of course, this difference is much more
          complex, because, in reality, the revenue usually doesn’t come
          directly from buying the app &mdash; and there are many more variables
          to account for; nevertheless, we can safely say that a paid app is not
          at all a safe bet for better quality.
        </p>

        <custom-h2 text="Cheap Wines vs Expensive Wines"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          We will perform a similar procedure to the one used with the apps
          dataset. But first let’s take a look at a problem that also happens
          with apps and is much more flagrant here:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="wines_prices_x_points.jpg" alt="" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          The graph above is a scatter plot of the price versus the rating or
          points (0 to 100), and we can clearly see that, for one given rating,
          we can get a wide range of prices, that is, to get a better wine, you
          don’t necessarily need to buy an expensive one.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s move on with the analysis and take a look at some histograms:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="hist_wine_prices.jpg" alt="" />
          <figcaption>
            The prices go up to $2300 in this dataset, but I chose to zoom into
            a narrower range to get a better look at the shape.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="hist_wine_points-1.jpg" alt="" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          The wine prices mean is of about $33, somewhat reasonable, but with an
          std of $37, a very big spread. When it comes to points, the shape is
          much closer to a normal distribution, with a mean of 87.87 and a std
          of 3.22, i.e., 66% of all the wines would have 84-90 points, or 95% of
          them would have 81-93 points; quite a lot of points, meaning that most
          wines do indeed have quality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, we divide the wines into 3 categories, that I’ve named as cheap
          (up to $10), expensive (from $10 to $100) and super expensive (more
          than $100). The respective means and stds are: 84.69, 2.06; 87.98,
          3.06; 92.80, 2.82. And, given that we now have samples around the
          thousands, we can safely say<foot-note
            text="I actually did test them with ANOVA and they passed with 
            absurd margins."
          ></foot-note>
          that there is indeed a meaningful statistical difference between these
          categories.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nonetheless, don’t be so sure about what that means in the real world,
          because numerous accounts report that oenophiles are very biased
          towards poshy wines. My suggestion is to be satisfied with cheap wines
          if you can’t buy the more expensive ones, since they have decently
          high scores anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another interesting sidenote before we wrap up this post is about the
          wine champions of this dataset: what are their prices? It will not
          surprise you that some of them have steep fees, but you can,
          unexpectedly, buy the top of the litter without going broke. Here are
          the 100-pointers (by name, country, region and price, respectively):
