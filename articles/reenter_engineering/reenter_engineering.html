        <p>
          In a sunny day, a year and a half ago, I was finally receiving my
          bachelor’s diploma, after six years<foot-note
            text="The standard is five years for engineering in Brazil."
          ></foot-note
          >, including one abroad, of a very long battle. What should have been
          a happy day turned out to be only the realization of my spirit’s
          depletion. University had absolutely crushed my enthusiasm. Frustrated
          by my lack of energy, I resorted to basically the only pleasure I had
          left: Go. Some months later I would go to South Korea to hone my
          skills and dedicate my whole being to the sport that gave me the joy I
          lacked while enduring the mostly bashing my head against the wall my
          engineering course was.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why? This whole time I was trying to understand the shitstorm those
          years were and I won’t claim I have all the answers, I’m not that
          wise, but some of the roots of the problem are quite clear to me now.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe the main reason of my torment was the teaching methodology
          &mdash; along with the basically total lack of guidance from the
          professors &mdash; prioritized by universities. For some reason, still
          in the 21st century, we still are victims of the bottom-up consensus,
          where the student, having no idea of what is going on, is forced to
          understand complicated concepts, in the hopes that someday an angelic
          comprehension of the whole might arrive, saving the day and, much more
          importantly, his or her confidence. Let me emphasize this last part:
          confidence. Let me repeat it to you: confidence. This is not a
          hyperbolic catchy statement to justify tautologically the phenomenon:
          it’s science.
        </p>

        <p>
          Studies in psychology attest the direct relationship between
          confidence and reasoning. Strained confidence invariably lowers the
          individual’s IQ, and the self-realization of the diminished
          capabilities triggers the feedback loop of a trap that sometimes may
          even become depression. That’s why, in interviews for companies with
          stressful environments, the interviewer usually attacks personal
          achievements and, only then, asks test’s questions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The relationship of the confidence loop with the bottom-up approach is
          key to understanding the failure of many, if not most, universities.
          Due to the uncertainty of not knowing the logical connections between
          the parts &mdash; i.e., the big picture &mdash; of what’s being
          taught, the student will always question if what he knows is not a
          mistake, a big and frequent blow to confidence.
        </p>

            text="This book is a true &lt;em&gt;chef-d’oeuvre&lt;/em&gt;, Scheff manages to compress 
            in only 200 pages the core of a field he studied his whole life, 
            and which is crucial to understanding social behaviour. I find 
            myself frequently going back to the fundamental, though not at 
            first so evidently important, concepts he mentions. In the future, 
            I will certainly make a detailed article about it, especially 
            about the pride-shame construct."
          ></foot-note
          >, by Thomas J. Scheff, what happens in the long run is discussed, and
          the author offers, from the literature, two solutions to break the
          loop, aside from a non-humiliating mentorship. The first one is, based
          on studies of numerous remarkable artists and philosophers &mdash;
          e.g., Nietzsche, Wagner and Freud &mdash;, the path to genius:
          laughter. Statistically, it was verified that the one true denominator
          among most of the geniuses is self-derision, a way of dispelling the
          negative effect of the bad loop by diminishing its value. However,
          more importantly, given it is much more common, the alternative
          solution might be even sadder than being a victim of the phenomenon:
          indifference. And that’s the epidemic which took over most of my
          colleagues. To defend oneself from the attacks of our course’s
          curriculum with the shield of indifference has become the norm for
          today’s students, which imperatively means the death of all the
          enthusiasm that brought them to the course in the first place. As a
          result, most of my peers would not even care about diverging from an
          engineer’s career, after all, at that point, it made no difference.
        </p>

        <p>
          But wait, there’s more. If you think the problems with bottom-upping
          end with the hideous confidence trap, you’ll be surprised. I will only
          cite here one of the other problems: the disparity between life in
          university and in the real world. And I don’t mean couchsurfing and
          partying regularly. The actual problem is that the courses, especially
          in exact sciences, focus all of their efforts in a firehose stream of
          bickering about details: there is too small an emphasis on the
          building of intuition, the bread and butter of everyday activities. In
          universities, you will find yourself for days embroiled in endless
          derivations that I assure you, unless you become a researcher, will
          mostly be useless<foot-note
            text="From my experience, the standard approach is to give you 
            examples and hope you will develop the necessary intuition from 
            them, which is quite similar to cleaning cars with circular 
            movements and hope to get a black belt in karate somehow: if MMA 
            has taught us anything, it’s that a direct punch to the face beats 
            fluffy artistic moves almost 100% of the time."
          ></foot-note
          >. While the intent of the professor with them is noble, not giving
          you guidance &mdash; some teachers do give you guidance, of course;
          while the vast majority usually provides either cryptic advice or
          statements with poor connections to the whole &mdash; of what exactly
          to focus on is a waste of your time and, also, his expertise.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this point, I hope I have convinced you that I had some reasons
          &mdash; perhaps I have been too extreme? &mdash; to distance myself
          from this field which distilled me of all my prior passion for exact
          sciences, left me with endless existential momentaneous insecurities
          and, in exchange, gave me a diploma. Lastly, with true sadness, I
          can’t help but downgrade most of the professors I’ve met as the worst
          type of tutor, the hypocrite kind, one that sees the pain of learning
          under such a centuries outdated horrible algorithm and, still, blames
          it on the student.

          In truth, this sabbatical period has been a rehab for me. I am finally
          close to fully disintoxicated, and soon I’ll be able to have a point
          of view less biased by my frustrations; and, hopefully, I’ll get a
          place at the field that most interests me right now: machine learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this last year and a half, I would say I had two major
          breakthroughs that really broadened my perspective on life and which I
          would like to briefly discuss here. The first one was my stay in South
          Korea and a trip to China.
        </p>

        <p>
          Naively, I went there thinking I would not have too much trouble
          trying to adapt, in part because I had already lived abroad in the
          past; and, also, due to globalization: I believed their habits, at
          this point in time, would be not so out of line with ours, westerners.
          Unsurprisingly, I was deeply wrong: the depth of the cultural
          difference between us is still abysmal. Everyday I was aghast at how
          they would mostly just follow the flow, repeat tasks and put their
          intuition above all other methods of achieving the same results
          &mdash; e.g. logic, the one I had invested most of my life on. That
          way of living caused a huge impact on me and, slowly, I am privileging
          intuition more and more over formal logical reasoning. We all make
          mistakes and we should use them to hone our intuition and not as a
          justification to question our knowledge at every step &mdash;
          curiously, that’s also the lesson machine learning is teaching us.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second turning point, perhaps even more crucial, has been studying
          for jobs in the government, which are obtained through open exams here
          in Brazil. The core of the change is in thinking about how to study,
          not only about what to study. A better method yields more efficiency,
          but, as you’re using the optimal solution, it also generates a
          significant boost to your confidence. This has been a deciding change
          for me; even though most of my praxis hasn’t changed, I am now much
          more confident, since I know that what I do is close to best<foot-note
            text="I will soon make an article about the many different methods 
            of studying I’ve learned so far, although, in short, I would say 
            the two more important, together with conforming to endless 
            repetition, are: flashcards and mind maps."

          In the last two weeks, I’ve noticed a big &mdash; and somewhat
          involuntary &mdash; change in my interests: I can’t even focus
          properly on my upcoming exam anymore! I’ve been frantically scooping
          the internet for everything related to machine learning, I’ve watched
          a lot of lectures, read many excerpts from various books and even
          coded some algorithms. All with the top-bottom<foot-note

            Science and Machine Learning. See fast.ai and deeplearning.ai for

          approach of first doing and then learning about the details. These
          last days have been a revolution in my life &mdash; one I hope, and
          feel, will last &mdash;, and I am finally, after years of flat out
          disinterest for life, enthusiastic about something again<foot-note
            text="I intend to post articles about my journey in machine 
            learning regularly from now on."
          ></foot-note
