      <h1>
        YouTube Kbd Nav: A Browser Extension to Enhance YouTube's UI and
        Keyboard Shortcuts
      </h1>

      <h2>1. Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        YouTube's UI/UX development is quite disappointing to me. At first and
        for years, they were very much ahead of everybody else in terms of UI/UX
        and overall innovation, but, as time goes on, what you see is stagnation
        and lack of initiative, i.e., less and less new features and
        improvements. As a result, competitors have been gaining a bigger and
        bigger market share. Websites and apps such as Vimeo, Twitch, Tiktok,
        Instagram, DTube<foot-note
          text="Boy, what a refuge for the Alt-Right..."
        ></foot-note
        >, etc., have all been filling gaps YouTube couldn't fill either due to
        its recent slow pace on innovation or the features simply not fitting or
        bloating its model.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/3Fx5Q8xGU8k"
          >Peter Thiel in his "Competition is for Losers" lecture</a
        >
        argues that, since monopolies have a lot of financial safety, innovation
        will be much more likely to happen. However, I think that's only true in
        their initial stages, when the future monopoly is trying to disrupt the
        status quo &mdash; and if you have employees and incentives focused on
        innovation. And that's not very far from what we see with the few
        established tech businesses such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, there are plenty of browser extensions which offer valuable
        features to YouTube's interface, most which would take less than a month
        for a Google developer to implement<foot-note
          text='Take the
        &lt;a
          href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/enhancer-for-youtube%E2%84%A2/dlgfaleeejmphhnemjgiaekdbonkagkd"
          &gt;Enhancer for YouTube&lt;/a
        &gt;, for instance.'
        ></foot-note
        >, and, yet, the internal initiative inside YouTube seems to be null.

      <h2>2. The YouTube Kbd Nav Browser Extension</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="demo.gif" alt="YouTube Kbd Nav Demo Gif" />

          <a href="https://github.com/FanaroEngineering/youtube_kbd_nav"
            >YouTube Kbd Nav</a
          >'s Demo GIF, which you can find in video form, on YouTube,
          <a href="https://youtu.be/DlvN_L5pd1Q">here</a>. New features might
          have been added since the creation of this GIF.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        With the lack of initiative in mind and enough know-how to enhance
        YouTube's UI myself, I chose to create a browser extension to add new
        keyboard shortcuts and some other visual aides to help the user navigate
        the behemoth more seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can look at the complete table of newly available shortcuts
        <a
          href="https://github.com/FanaroEngineering/youtube_kbd_nav#13-available-shortcuts"
          >here</a
        >. Keep in mind that they may change in the future &mdash; if you're
        installing through the extension stores, updates will be done
        automatically &mdash;, and that there are already many forbidden keys I
        cannot use because they are already used either by YouTube itself or the
        browser. Even though the extension is published on the Chrome's,
        Microsoft Edge's and Firefox's extension stores, if you're really
        interested in this particular extension, I highly suggest you take a
        look at both the
        <a href="https://github.com/FanaroEngineering/youtube_kbd_nav/releases"
          >release</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://github.com/FanaroEngineering/youtube_kbd_nav/issues"
          >issue</a
        >
        pages.
      </p>

      <p>At any rate, most of the core functionalities are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Ability to cycle, with only the keyboard, the thumbnails on a YouTube
          page.
        </li>
        <li>Shortcuts for YouTube's home and history pages.</li>
        <li>A shortcut for copying the link of the current video.</li>
        <li>
          A visual decoration on the video element so you know if it is the
          currently focused element or not &mdash; this is accompanied by a
          shortcut for (un)focusing the video element.
        </li>
        <li>A shortcut for focusing on the comment box.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can download the extension through the following links:</p>

      <h2>4. Extra Info</h2>

      <p>
        The whole interface and idea behind this extension are largely inspired
        by the underappreciated and largely unknown
        <a href="https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator"
          >Web Search Navigator</a
        >
        browser extension. It is by far the extension which most
        improved<foot-note
          text="We developers spend a lot of our time googling stuff..."
        ></foot-note>
        my browser productivity and follows the same line of argumentation I
        described above, that is: why the hell hasn't Google implemented
        something so simple and so useful???

          Scholar, Github and YouTube, though they are currently experimental,
          and much more limited than this extension when it comes YouTube.
