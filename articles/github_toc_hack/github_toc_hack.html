      <p>
        For large pieces of documentation, it's pretty much typical to create a
        Table of Contents (TOC) in Markdown &mdash; usually in the
        <code>README.md</code>
        file itself. This is usually automated through IDE extensions and the
        result ends up being a nested bulleted (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) or
        numbered list (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>). It usually looks like this:
      </p>

      <img src="normal_toc.PNG" alt="Typical Github TOC" height="215px" />

      <p>
        That's really not ideal, because the bullet points are just unnecessary
        noise, boilerplate. With CSS, you could add a
        <code>list-style-type: none;</code> and have the problem disappear.
        However, Github tries its best to cleanse the user's custom styling,
        lest they could completely distort Github's content and UI/UX, which
        completely reasonable. In the second item of
        <a href="https://github.com/github/markup#github-markup"
          >Github Markup</a
        >'s process for each repository:
      </p>

      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        (...) aggressively removing things that could harm you and your kinâ€”such
        as script tags, inline-styles, and class or id attributes.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, they aren't doing that aggressively enough. After about half an
        hour trying to bypass these restrictions and trying every HTML/CSS way I
        knew to style this list, I stumbled upon a that almost did the trick.
        The only problem was that Github was leaving the style tag in-line on
        the final document as text &mdash; something like this:
        <code
          >&lt;style&gt; #TOC ul { list-style-type: none; } &lt;/style&gt;</code
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        After insisting that there should be a hack somewhere, I tried examining
        the HTML code with the browser inspector. And there I found the hack,
        the <code>user-content-toc</code> ID. Maybe Github wanted to release
        this feature at some point for their Markdown "compiler" but couldn't
        for some reason. At any rate, the final hack/solution is to wrap your
        list with a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and then add the
        <code>user-content-toc</code> ID:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="html">&lt;div id="user-content-toc"&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code>
      </pre>

      <figure style="margin-left: 35px">
        <img src="toc_screenshot.PNG" alt="Custom TOC" />
        <figcaption>Less boilerplatey Table of Contents on Github.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Keep in mind that this will surely not be ideal. Because Github might
        change the <code>id</code> at any point in time, which would break your
        styling. Nevertheless, in the case this <code>id</code> disappears, at
        the worst, things will simply default to <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> &mdash;
        which is not as bad as the case where they completely distort the
        <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>'s behavior, so watch out!
