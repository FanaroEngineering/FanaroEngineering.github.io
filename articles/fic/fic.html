      <h1>FIC: Fast Immutable Collections</h1>

      <p>
        Have you ever wondered if there was a way of getting rid of the plague
        of mutability in OOP and imperative languages? Or maybe restrict it? If
        you did, you're not alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Managing many objects each inside their respective architectural layers
        can be an even bigger challenge if they keep unexpectedly changing
        throughout their lifetimes. Joshua Bloch even goes so far as to state in
        <em>Effective Java</em
        ><foot-note
          text="Chapter 4: Classes and Interfaces, page 86 of the 3rd Edition."
        ></foot-note
        >:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Classes should be immutable unless there’s a very good reason to make
        them mutable.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Interestingly, if you're a Java programmer, one of the main
        <em>raison d'êtres</em> of the language is to abstract away the use of
        pointers, which is a lower level manifestation of mutability. James
        Gosling, the main developer of Java, deliberately set out to make it
        close to impossible for people to deal with pointers and direct memory
        allocation because they were the #1 source of bugs in lower level
        languages like C &mdash; that's also <em>the</em> reason for
        garbage-collection.

      <!-- TODO: Mention the extensive amount of resources in the README file. -->

      <!-- TODO: Mention a link to the video on how Clojure manages its immutable data: through the HAMT. -->
      <!-- TODO: Also mention that this would be the main alternative for when redesigning the project. -->
