          Have you ever wondered if there was a way of getting rid of the plague
          of mutability in OOP and imperative languages? Or maybe restrict it?
          If you did, you're not alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Managing many objects each inside their respective architectural
          layers can be an even bigger challenge if they keep unexpectedly
          changing throughout their respective lifetimes. Joshua Bloch even goes
          as far as to state:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Classes should be immutable unless there’s a very good reason to
            make them mutable.

          Interestingly, if you're a Java programmer, one of the main
          <em>raisons d'êtres</em> of the language itself is to abstract away
          the use of pointers, which is a lower level manifestation of
          mutability. James Gosling, the main developer/creator of Java,
          deliberately set out to make it very difficult for people to deal with
          pointers and direct memory allocation because they were the #1 source
          of bugs in lower level languages like C &mdash; that's also
          <em>the</em> reason for garbage-collection's existence.

          <p>
            Pure functional programming languages try to respect mathematical
            functions, which, by definition, need to be deterministic, meaning,
            if you input something, the output needs to <em>always</em> be the
            same.

            But how can anything be useful in the real world without any state?
            Well, it's a bit complicated and counter-intuitive, but there's a
            solution for abstracting state and still remaining pure, namely,
            Monads.

          Dart doesn't feature native immutable collections<foot-note

          &mdash; unlike other modern OOP languages, like Kotlin &mdash; every
          object has its own equals operator (<code>==</code>) defaulting to
          reference equality (<code>identity</code>). In the end, they are
          actually more or less like sealed pointers to memory locations. This
          means that doing something like
          <code>Person("Bob") == Person("Bob")</code> will yield
          <code>false</code>, since those objects are not the same instance or

          is an annoyance we can't really fully get around. But for these types
          of atomic, entity, data or value objects, it isn't such a big deal.
          Most of your architectural work &mdash; and grunt work &mdash; will
          actually be orchestrating them, which is where FIC comes in.
        </p>

        <p>
          In your next layer of abstraction, it is very likely you might end up
          with a <em>collection</em> of these simple objects, like a
          <em>set</em>, <em>list</em> or <em>map</em> of <code>Person</code>.
          Once you get there, you might want to deploy the same tactic you used
          for layer one, meaning the collections themselves will be immutable.
          If you don't, changes to the objects in the collections might happen
          without your knowledge, because there will be no programmatic way of
          detecting them &mdash; static analysis, for instance, won't point it
          out it because it is a valid feature.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that you've hopefully decided to also make your collection objects
          immutable, you're gonna have to solve the problem of internally
          dealing with
          <em>mutable operations on top of mutable collections</em>, such as
          Dart's <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code> and <code>Map</code>.
          Eventually, you might come up with the typical pattern of creating a
          private constructor to help manage the endless and dangerous
          collection copies you're gonna have to manage inside the object's
          state:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="dart">@immutable
class People {
  final List&lt;Person&gt; _people;

  People(List&lt;Person&gt; people): _people = List.of(people);

  /// Since there are no references to the list once it is inside
  /// the object, there's no need for copying.
  People._(this._people);

  // An example of immutable operaton on a mutable collection
  // (List). Now imagine dozens of these operations, each needing
  // extra care from you in order to not cause any side effects.
  People add(Person person) {
    var newPeopleList = List.of(_people)..add(person);
    return People._(newPeopleList);
  } 

  // If you want to create value equality for this class, you will
  // need to override reference equality. The simplest way is to 
  // do this is to use the `collection` package.
  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) =&gt; 
      identical(this, other) ||
      other is People &amp;&amp;
      runtimeType == other.runtimeType &amp;&amp;
      const ListEquality().equals(_people, other._people);

  @override
  int get hashCode =&gt; const ListEquality().hash(_people);

  @override
  String toString() =&gt; _people.toString();

  // Optionally, you could also write your own list equality. 
  // Something close to this:
  bool _listEquals&lt;T&gt;(List&lt;T&gt; a, List&lt;T&gt; b) {
    if (a == null)
      return b == null;
    if (b == null || a.length != b.length)
      return false;
    if (identical(a, b))
      return true;
    // Don't write this recursively, you might end up with 
    // space leaks. For more info on this, check out 
    // Tail Call Optimization (TCO).
    for (int index = 0; index &lt; a.length; index += 1) {
      if (a[index] != b[index]) return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
}</code>
        </pre>

        <blockquote>
          Pay close attention! It's very important that
          <strong
            >all of the items in the supposedly immutable collection are all
            immutable</strong
          >. You absolutely cannot have items changing state in a supposedly
          immutable collection, all the more because static analysis will not
          typically warn you at any point about any of the changes.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The <code>People._</code> constructor avoids wasteful recopying of the
          <code>_people</code> list through the public constructor, since you've
          already copied it inside the "mutation" method
          (<code>People.add</code>). But this type of pattern is clunky and
          needs a lot of boilerplate. Not to mention that, even though, from the
          outside, programmers can't change the inner list, whoever is working
          inside the object still has a ton of room for mistakes.
        </p>

        <p>
          This situation is where FIC shines. Its collections are already
          programmatically sealed for mutable operations. There is no room for
          the programmer to mutate its collections, and all that while
          minimizing boilerplate and arguably vastly simplifying the code:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="dart">@immutable
class PeopleWithFic {
  final IList&lt;Person&gt; people;

  PeopleWithFic(this.people);

  PeopleWithFic add(Person person) => 
      PeopleWithFic(people.add(person));

  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) =&gt;
      identical(this, other) ||
      other is People &amp;&amp;
      runtimeType == other.runtimeType &amp;&amp;
      people == other.people;

  @override
  int get hashCode =&gt; people.hashCode;
}</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          FIC uses deep equality by default, which makes dealing with
          collections of values much more natural and concise. And now you can
          treat the whole inner list as a value,
          <code>people == other.people</code> actually works safely and as most
          people would expect. The whole list is immutable and locked so, if you
          wish, you can now expose the <code>people</code> attribute/property
          publicly.

          excellent packages, you could use either of them instead of FIC and
          live happily ever after. Nonetheless, when it comes to the end user,
          the programmer, FIC offers some valuable contributions/improvements:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The
            <a href="https://github.com/google/built_collection.dart"
              >built_collection</a

            package is based on the

              >Builder Design Pattern</a
            >, which helps in making it very fast, since operations on
            collections will only complete when you "rebuild" the collection,
            almost like lazy collections. However, going through the builder
            pattern as an API leads to somewhat cumbersome code, and you have to
            remember when to rebuild your collections. FIC offers a much more
            natural API with near-equal performance, something we will discuss
            in the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the other side of the spectrum,
            <a href="https://github.com/passsy/kt.dart">kt.dart</a> brings the
            easier Kotlin Collections API while making some sacrifices in
            performance, since it mostly copies the collection on every
            "mutable" operation. FIC brings in the regular, intuitive OOP
            collection API and plenty of functional operations, while avoiding
            copies and preserving performance.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Why is FIC fast?"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          FIC's whole implementation is complicated. There are a lot of details.
          But one of those details is worth knowing even for those who don't
          want to have anything to do with developing this package.
        </p>

        <p>
          The major detail is that FIC doesn't actually copy
          <em>everything</em> whenever the user attempts a mutable operation.
          For example, when adding elements to a list, FIC will sort of "create
          an internal variable" that points to those elements. This is similar
          to the structure of data in many functional programming languages: in
          the end it becomes something like a (recursive) tree or a
          trie<foot-note
            text='Rich Hickey, the author of Clojure, explains all this for 
            the context of his own language 
            &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/wASCH_gPnDw?t=1941"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;'
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the data you're trying to add is a single item or an immutable
          collection, FIC will create a recursive branch in its structure. So,
          in the end, if you're adding a huge immutable <code>IList</code> to
          another <code>IList</code>, the change will be virtually immediate,
          much faster than the native <code>List</code>s actually. If you add a
          regular <code>List</code> to an <code>IList</code>, then FIC will need
          to make an immutable, safe copy though, that's why we recommend that,
          once you decide to go for FIC, we recommend sticking to it throughout
          the whole process, algorithm or application.
        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="The Benchmark App"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          FIC features two other inner packages: <code>benchmark</code> and
          <code>benchmark_app</code> &mdash; they are now inside the
          <code>example</code> folder. The benchmark app package uses the
          benchmark package to run many of the typical collection operations and
          compare the different collection packages to each other.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="demo.gif" alt="Demo GIF" />

            collections to others. Use it preferably in release mode.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Overall, FIC performs very well. In most cases, it is on par with the
          native collections, and sometimes it even beats them, as in the case
          of <code>IList.addAll</code>. But sometimes it is indeed slower than
          expected, even though not by that much &mdash; some operations on maps
          and sets did not end up being so optimal within FIC's design context.

        This list is simply a copy paste of the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/fast_immutable_collections#11-introduction"
          >introductory section</a
        >
        of the &mdash; very thorough &mdash; documentation:

        <ul>
          <li><code>IList</code>, an immutable list</li>
          <li><code>ISet</code>, an immutable set</li>
          <li><code>IMap</code>, an immutable map</li>
          <li>
            <code>IMapOfSets</code>, an immutable map of sets (a multimap)
          </li>
          <li>
            Lock and unlock extensions, so you can easily transform mutable
            collections into immutable ones, and vice-versa. For example:
            <code>[1, 2].lock</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Global and local configurations that alter how your immutable
            collections behave with respect to equality, sorting, caching, and
            flushing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optional deep equalities and cached hash codes, which let you treat
            your collections as value-objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mixins for you to build your own immutable collections or objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            View wrappers, so that you can work with immutable collection as if
            they were mutable.
          </li>
        </ul>

        And other valuable features:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>ListSet</code>, a very efficient fixed-size mutable
              collection which is at the same time an ordered
              <code>Set</code> and a <code>List</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>ListMap</code> is a mutable, fixed-sized, and ordered map
              which has some very efficient <code>List</code> methods, like
              <code>sort</code> and <code>shuffle</code>, and lets you
              efficiently read its information by index.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              General purpose extensions to the native collections:
              <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, <code>Map</code>. See classes
              <code>FicListExtension</code>, <code>FicSetExtension</code>, and
              <code>FicMapExtension</code>. For example:
              <code>[1, 2, 1].removeDuplicates()</code>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Other extensions: <code>IterableExtension</code>,
              <code>IteratorExtension</code>, <code>MapIteratorExtension</code>,
              <code>FicComparatorExtension</code>,
              <code>FicComparableExtension</code> and
              <code>FicBooleanExtension</code>. For example:
              <code>false.compareTo(true)</code>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Comparators and related helpers to be used with native or
              immutable collections, or any sort algorithms, such as
              <code>compareObject</code>, <code>sortBy</code>,
              <code>sortLike</code>, <code>if0</code>, in
              <code>sort.dart</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

          Developing FIC took way longer than both I and
          <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg">Marcelo Glasberg</a>
          expected. Marcelo is a much more experienced and savvy programmer and
          the one responsible for 90% of the design and implementation. My work
          was about 90% testing and trying to poke holes into his code to find
          bugs<foot-note
            text="Not classic TDD &mdash; since the person implementing is 
            not the same as the one testing &mdash; but we both had limited 
            time in our hands, so this division of labor was the best we 
            could get."

          So far, since publishing this package on
          <a href="https://pub.dev/">pub.dev</a>, we've found very few problems.
          And Marcelo and I have been using it internally in his own company, so
          we believe FIC is ready for whatever its use may be. But you never
          know... if you ever face any bug, please do us and the community a
          favor and report them

          Regardless of each person's attributions, we both had to research and
          read a ton of articles to complete this project. I took the time of
          cataloguing all of these resources in the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/fast_immutable_collections#17-bibliography"
            >bibliography section of the documentation</a
          >, but some of the other final sections also feature these resources
          indirectly.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we ever come back to redesign this project or create something
          similar, we plan on diving deeper into
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie"
            >Hash Array Mapped Tries (HAMT)</a
          >, which is a very important data structure for functional programming
          languages' implementations &mdash; you can watch Rich Hickey, the
          author of Clojure, explain a little bit a about this data structure
